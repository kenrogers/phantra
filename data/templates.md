## 1\. The AIDA copywriting formula

Tasleem executes the proven AIDA copywriting formula:

- He grabs **Attention** with a captivating hook that shatters a common belief

- He holds **Interest** by sharing concrete ways to pick up the pieces

- He stirs **Desire** by teasing with new and tangible possibilities

- He then invites us to switch our mindset and take **Action**

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/GaBRJXDOCpAP9MeoHbVopPzhMY.png)

### Here’s the post template:

It’s impossible to \[achieve a common goal\] on/in \[platform/tool/group\] today.

Instead, here's what's achievable today:

\- You can \[specific action\] to \[achieve specific goal\].

\- You can \[specific action\] to \[achieve specific goal\].

\- You can \[specific action\] to \[achieve specific goal\].

\- You can \[specific action\] to \[achieve specific goal\].

It’ll only take you \[realistic time investment\].

However, in \[relatively short time frame\], you’ll have:

\- \[Desirable outcome\]

\- \[Desirable outcome\]

\- \[Desirable outcome\]

Don’t say:

"I want to \[achieve common goal\] on/in \[platform/tool/group\] today"

Instead, say:

"I want to \[engage in specific daily action\] today"

Pick \[new strategy for success\] over \[common but less effective strategy\].

P.S. \[Foster follower engagement with a personal sign-off\]

## 2\. How to get eyeballs on your long-form content

David borrows credibility from his podcast guest, Morgan Housel, to grab our attention.

He then mentions an impressive achievement of Morgan’s (i.e. “sold more than 4 million copies of his book”). This helps pique curiosity and cement Morgan as a trusted authority in our minds.

Referencing credible sources, experts, and brands can increase the reader’s trust in what you say. In turn, this can boost your content’s persuasiveness and reach.

### Here’s the post template:

\[Person’s name\] \[has done a remarkable thing\] with \[topic/product\]. Here's how they \[approach specific skill\]:

1\. \[Practical tip shared in long-form content\]

2\. \[Practical tip shared in long-form content\]

3\. \[Practical tip shared in long-form content\]

4\. \[Practical tip shared in long-form content\]

Here’s the full \[resource\]: \[Link\]

## 3\. The Slippery Slide Effect

Codie uses a timeless copywriting technique.

She keeps her first few sentences ultra short. Avoids multisyllabic words. And uses incomplete sentences, which has us flying down the page.

We’re already 5 lines deep before a sentence exceeds 6 words. By which point…

We’re hooked!

This concept of “pulling the reader in” is known as The Slippery Slide Effect.

“The sole purpose of the first sentence is to get \[readers\] to read the second sentence and the sole purpose of the second sentence is get them to read the third and then the forth”.

— Master Copywriter, Joseph Sugarman

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/bcKNqt3fpHDHYwc6rd3dL2m9tU.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Concept 1\] = \[Outcome 1\]. \[Concept 2\] = \[Outcome 2\].

It's not the \[concept 1/desire\] we want. It's the \[deeper desire\].

Yet...

We all know the cliche, \[common saying or belief\]. Despite the \[deeper desire\], many let \[concept 1/desire\] shackle them in a new way.

The new \[ideal goal\] is to be \[desirable state\]. How do you achieve this?

I got obsessed with this idea as I began \[hitting my goals\]. I’ve spent \[considerable timeframe\] getting to know \[relevant individuals/topic\], and studying those who \[reached desirable state\].

What do you think the answer is?

It’s an idea I’ve been organising my thoughts on for a while. Sometime in \[timeframe\], I’ll have a \[content asset\] out on it.

Feel free to \[subscribe/follow/sign up\] if that’s something you’d want to see: \[Link\]

## 4\. “LinkedIn loves stories” — Justin Welsh

Your stories don’t need to be epic blockbusters. Timothy’s transformation story is only 8 short sentences long.

But what makes Timothy's story so compelling?

Well, three things:

1\. It showcases a **transformation** as he goes from humble beginnings to achieving success in business

2\. It’s **relatable** as he doesn’t start with a silver spoon in his mouth

3\. It’s **inspiring** as he overcomes common obstacles

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UwZsBh88AY8HEVg2Ejk3AUByswc.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I grew up here.

\[Share 1-2 details of living circumstances and/or location\]

X years ago, I decided to \[pursue a goal\].

I/We didn’t have \[an advantage\].

I/We didn’t even know what a \[common means to achieve goal\] was.

I/We \[took specific actions\] and \[achieved goal\].

\[Short timeframe\] ago, I/we \[reached a significant achievement\].

This post isn’t to brag.

It’s to show that regardless of where you start, you can \[empowering message\].

I didn’t choose to live in \[humble starting point\].

I didn’t choose to \[put up with specific adversity\].

I did choose to get out of that.

Truth is you can/have \[universal truth or insight\].

You may not be in control of where you start.

But you are in control of where you finish.

## 5\. Warning: This post may get you worked up!

On reading this post, you’ll no doubt feel a sense of outrage on Mita’s behalf.

Which serves as a lesson: Every good story needs _conflict_. A villain.

Mita calls out her villain in sentence two (“a manager”).

Conflict not only grabs attention but also raises the stakes and gets us emotionally invested.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/LbFOOKUQt5uzLmqG4iTJqopjXs.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Once upon a time.

I \[experienced a challenging and slightly unusual situation\]:

\- \[Issue/behaviour and its impact\]

\- \[Issue/behaviour and its impact\]

\- \[Issue/behaviour and its impact\]

Sure, \[type of situation\] happens in \[given context\].

Sometimes we have to \[reasonable response\].

But here’s what I could never understand:

Why does \[specific issue\] become \[consequence of the issue\]?

## 6\. The PAS copywriting formula

Dakota uses the PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solve) copywriting formula:

1\. He lays out the problem → overthinking

2\. He makes it hurt → unresolved open loops are a pain

3\. He gives a solution → writing (and here’s how you can apply it…)

He uses PAS to empathise with readers, intensify their desire for a solution, then relieve the tension he’s built with a soothing remedy.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wP85lKjUewTxKvYul4VTuLKdZhc.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Give an impressive, relatable fact\].

\[Give another fact that builds on the first\].

This explains why \[you/we\] can \[perform specific action OR reach specific goal\].

But because of \[these facts\], \[a negative consequence can occur\].

\[Name a negative consequence\].

\[Briefly explain the relevance of the consequence\].

So, how do \[you/we\] \[resolve this issue\]?

\[Name a solution\].

\[Briefly explain the relevance of the solution\].

Here are \[X actionable tips/questions/steps\] to help get you started:

\- \[Tip/Question/Step 1\]

\- \[Tip/Question/Step 2\]

\- \[Tip/Question/Step 3\]

\- \[Tip/Question/Step 4\]

Take \[timeframe\] to \[follow this advice\] and you'll \[unlock key benefit\].

\[Relatable text image to act as a ‘billboard’ for your post\]

## 7\. Don’t do this… Instead, do this…

A key reason for low engagement is a lack of credibility. Unfamiliar readers will wonder why they should listen to you.

_“What qualifies you to speak about \[Topic\]?”_

Dina tackles this objection straight away in her hook. 118 connection requests in a couple of hours is extraordinary by anyone’s standards.

This admission helps position her as sought-after, lending credibility to her advice and opinions that follow.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/kdYH43b0J6KrbL2FzGVFZ75Jw.png)

### Here’s the post template:

This week, I \[experienced a remarkable/unusual event\].

Here are \[X\] ways I wouldn't recommend to \[related activity\]:

1\. \[Common ineffective approach 1\]

\[Explain why it's ineffective\]

2\. \[Common ineffective approach 2\]

\[Explain why it's ineffective\]

3\. \[Common ineffective approach 3\]

\[Explain why it's ineffective\]

This is how I'd do it instead:

1\. \[Effective strategy 1\]. \[Brief explanation\].

2\. \[Effective strategy 2\]. \[Brief explanation\].

3\. \[Effective strategy 3\]. \[Brief explanation\].

Remember:

\[Takeaway that summarises why this advice is important\]

## 8\. How to build anticipation for a new product

Ryan uses a simple “failure-success” story to stir up interest for his new product.

We humans are innately curious about where people, things, and ideas come from. Ryan leans into this fact by explaining how this new product came to be. By sharing his initial struggles, he shows his audience that he wasn’t willing to settle.

This implies he has standards and has gone to great lengths to ensure this product is top-notch. In turn, this helps foster trust and anticipation amongst his readers.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OgVnjkN4hWEE3NatK9gKrmXL4Q.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I’m \[feeling/emotion\]. It’s a big \[day/week/month\].

On \[day/date\], I’m launching \[product/service\].

Initially, things didn’t go as planned:

\- \[Challenge 1\]

\- \[Challenge 2\]

\- \[Challenge 3\]

\[Anecdote or fact about past struggles\].

I didn't think it would happen.

But now, it’s ready.

It’s designed to be your \[desirable solution\].

This is what I use to \[achieve shared goal\].

It’s what I needed when I was struggling.

It’s what I needed when I first started.

It helps you \[unlock benefit 1\], \[benefit 2\], and \[benefit 3\].

Join me on \[day/date\] for \[promotional event\].

It’s at \[time\] am/pm \[time zone\].

Plus if you attend, you’ll be in with a chance of \[giveaway/incentive\].

## 9\. How to lead with vulnerability and inspire others

Katelyn tells a very honest “struggle-recovery” story. Not only does she share her struggles, but she does so in a visual, emotive way.

Here are some examples:

\- “I needed to _stretch_ every penny…”

\- “I was _forced_ to file for bankruptcy”

\- “The _stench_ of bankruptcy was finally _washed_ away”

Katelyn doesn’t have to word her sentences like this. In fact, it’s more concise to say:

\- “I needed every penny…”

\- “I was bankrupt”

\- “I was no longer bankrupt”

But it’s not nearly as compelling. She dramatises her writing with vivid words that play on the senses.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OPKO0HT32LyNAAFrwzmLNMRFzm4.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[X years\] ago, my \[type of venture\] failed.

Despite not having \[type of support\], I was determined to succeed.

I \[methods of funding and effort\] for the first \[X month/years\].

Eventually I tried \[alternative method of funding and effort\], but I knew \[related risks/challenges\] so I had to \[make specific sacrifice\].

I \[related struggle\]. \[Negative consequence\].

That \[venture\] failed, and I faced \[severe consequences\].

For \[X month/years\], I dealt with \[specific repercussions\].

I worried about whether I could even \[carry out a relatively normal task\].

However, \[X weeks/months\] ago…

\[Positive turn or resolution\].

Why am I telling you this?

Because what you see online isn’t the whole story.

People only show you what they want you to see.

So if you're experiencing \[specific type of hardship\] right now, I assure you it won't last forever.

\[Wise parting advice/quote\]

## 10\. Good strategy → Great strategy

There are levels to any game you wish to play in life. And to reach the upper levels of anything, often takes a different approach.

Mat lays out a clear progression of strategies that illustrate what’s necessary to reach the upper levels of LinkedIn personal branding.

You can apply this same approach to your own area of expertise.

Simply make a list of strategies, starting with what most people do, and progressing up to what most experts do.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/fbDkVf7G2UMK254PviRxwaqUn9Y.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Amateur: "I \[basic activity\] \[on/with\] \[Platform/Product/Strategy\]."

Intermediate:

"I \[basic activity\] and \[additional activity\]."

Advanced:

"I \[basic activity\], \[additional activity\], and \[another activity\]."

Expert:

"I \[basic activity\], \[additional activity\], \[another activity\], \[further activity\], and \[final activity\]."

The reality:

\[Achieving specific goal\] requires more than just \[basic activity\].

## 11\. How to celebrate a win (without bragging)

_“Celebrating every win or success you have is a massively underrated marketing play”_

_— Harry Dry (Marketing Examples)_

People love success stories. They motivate, educate, and inspire us. But how do we share our wins without bragging?

Well, Justin does so in a way that’s relatable and authentic.

- First, he shares how he started without any unfair advantage

- He then shows appreciation for his readers and the Favikon team (before even mentioning his achievement)

- And lastly, he turns the attention back to his readers

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Q8XOGgSIjrguyHMzgUJtaacJU8A.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I \[started engaging with specific action\] on \[date\].

At first, I \[briefly list common experiences/initial failures/struggles\].

\[X years/months\] later, I’ve \[sustained a specific level of effort\].

This has led to \[positive impacts/results\].

I’m grateful to know my work offers \[specific value\] to others.

Special thanks to \[Organization/Individual\] for \[Specific Recognition\].

If you’re just getting going or on a similar path, remember:

\[Motivational advice\].

You won’t regret \[engaging in specific action\] and \[impacting others\].

Here’s a \[resource/tip\] to help you get started: \[Link\]

## 12\. “Pssst…Wanna know a secret?”

Austin’s hook implies he has a “secret” method. This stirs up curiosity and gets people reading.

There’s something incredibly compelling about a secret, isn’t there?

If a friend offers to tell us a secret, we can’t help but lean in. The fact they’re willing to share information they’ve chosen to withhold from others, makes us feel special.

The same goes for teasing a “secret” in your writing.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JkVaOJNp5DYKaLEgZlFzFCCk6U.png)

### Here’s the post template:

People ask me how I \[achieved desirable outcome\] so quickly.

My secret?

I \[daily action\].

People ask me how I \[achieved desirable outcome\].

My secret?

I \[daily action\].

People ask me how I \[achieved desirable outcome\].

My secret?

I \[daily action\].

But the truth is…

There is no secret, just \[core principle\].

To \[achieve key desirable outcome\], you have to \[high-level advice\].

Here are \[X steps/tips/strategies/questions\] to get you started:

1. \[Step/Tip/Strategy/Question\]

2. \[Step/Tip/Strategy/Question\]

3. \[Step/Tip/Strategy/Question\]

4. \[Step/Tip/Strategy/Question\]

5. \[Step/Tip/Strategy/Question\]

Want to \[Attain desirable role/outcome\]?

\[Conduct specific daily action\]

Remember, showing up daily is what separates \[desirable group\] from the rest.

Start today.

## 13\. What PROMISE are you making to the reader?

Make no mistake, posting on LinkedIn is a competitive sport. You’re competing for attention.

That’s why you must deliver on the promise you make to your reader.

_“What will they get in exchange for reading your post?”_

In line 2, [Lara](https://kleo.so/blog/lara-acosta) promises a “huge LinkedIn-related lesson.” While it’s her story, by mentioning what the reader stands to gain, she gives them a worthwhile reason to read on.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/7itlGbS2pExtFEAFir2OjS6K80.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I \[achieved remarkable outcome\] \[through unexpected means\].

\[X years/months\] ago, I \[met/supported someone\] at \[event/scenario\].

They’re also \[role/accomplishment/recognition\].

\[Short time period ago\], I reached out to them because:

- I \[related struggle\]

- I \[related struggle\]

- I \[related struggle\]

This led to:

- \[Positive individual/shared outcome\]

- \[Positive individual/shared outcome\]

- \[Positive individual/shared outcome\]

Which later led to \[remarkable outcome\].

And it all stems from \[relevant details from initial encounter\].

All this has taught me \[valuable lesson\] in \[specific context\].

\[Sum up core message/lesson\].

\[Image that matches the post\]

## 14\. Pair your advice with credibility elements

People will naturally wonder why they should listen to you. Even Dan, a well-known coach with nearly 330,000 followers, works to earn the reader’s trust.

So rather than just giving unsolicited advice, he first shares a relevant principle (“The Rule of 2”). This evokes an air of legitimacy, which makes his advice even more credible and trustworthy.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wvbDHzAXptubAeCMdXXpDnei7I.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Name of Rule/Wisdom\]:

\[Context\] is tough. \[Setbacks\] happen.

Ensure your next action aligns with your goals.

- \[Experienced specific setback\]? \[Respond with positive related action\].

- \[Experienced specific setback\]? \[Respond with positive related action\].

- \[Experienced specific setback\]? \[Respond with positive related action\].

\[Share relevant quote/wise advice\]

\[Reiterate Rule/Wisdom as practical takeaway\]

\[Relatable text image to act as a ‘billboard’ for your post\]

## 15\. Are you making this mistake?

We humans have evolved to perceive mistakes as potentially life-threatening. No one sets out to make mistakes. So when people point them out, they get our attention.

Mistake hooks tap into a powerful attention-grabbing mechanism known as loss aversion (or fear of missing out - FOMO).

When people read Jasmin’s hook, they’ll stop and think, _“Yikes! I hope I’m not one of the 90%. Let’s check…”_

By which point, the hook has done its job.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dk1TDJEdKjsoC978mvYK8hbRmcs.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[High number\]% of \[digital asset/group\] make this mistake:

Did you know by \[following common practice\], you are actually \[eliciting negative outcome\]?

Try/Think about it like this instead:

- \[Step/tip/intended use\]

- \[Step/tip/intended use\]

- \[Step/tip/intended use\]

(but this won’t happen if \[negative outcome\])

The goal is \[desired outcome\], not \[undesirable outcome\].

## 16\. How to create “valuable” content

You may well be thinking… What exactly is “valuable” content?

The term “value” is such a meaningless buzzword, so let’s define it:

_**Valuable content** is well-structured information that helps people overcome a specific problem and attain a desirable outcome._

Think of your “value” content as _a bridge_, helping your reader get from point A to point B.

Here’s how Dan achieves this with his post below:

- First, he breaks down a desirable goal, making it seem more achievable (Here, the problem is implied – i.e. “ _How do I make 6 figures a year? What does that even look like?”)_

- Then, he gives a clear roadmap with specific strategies and systems (the bridge or “process”)

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/cFlIfceWfZ7zeREylMVwhO2eJY.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Specific quantifiable goal\]/\[short timeframe\] = \[Specific quantifiable goal\] in \[long timeframe\]

That's the goal.

To get there, you can either:

- \[Method A\]

- \[Method B\]

Just carry out these daily tasks:

- \[Daily strategic task 1\]

- \[Daily strategic task 2\]

- \[Daily strategic task 3\]

Here’s an example of what that looks like:

1. \[Specific example of “daily strategic task 1”\]

2. \[Specific example of “daily strategic task 2”\]

3. \[Specific example of “daily strategic task 3”\]

Now all you have to do is \[additional action\] and you \[achieve desirable outcome\].

As you progress, incorporate:

- \[Less frequent action 1\]

- \[Less frequent action 2\]

- \[Less frequent action 3\]

Following this exact \[Strategy Name\] for \[time period\] has helped me \[unlock benefit\] and \[unlock additional benefit\].

It’s more effective than \[alternative strategy\].

## 17\. Why you should give more examples

By themselves, ideas and concepts (even with a clear explanation) can seem abstract. Information is only useful if we know how to apply it.

So pair your ideas with examples to help deepen your reader’s understanding. Examples simplify complex concepts. They also make ideas more visual, relatable, and memorable.

Nir uses an example to show how the planning fallacy phenomenon occurs in a real-world context. While the research findings appeal to our logical brain, examples engage our creative brain.

They help paint a picture, making ideas easier to grasp.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BOFYd3waf51w0N9yt2nvhAvJ2Fo.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Startling fact or statistic\]

But why \[relevant question/problem\]?

Introducing \[concept or phenomenon\].

Research shows:

\[Summarize key findings and/or expert opinions\].

The main reason for this is \[explain reason in simple terms\].

It's like when \[relatable example\].

So, what can we do?

\[Introduce specific solution\].

\[Briefly explain why it works and the expected outcome\].

So next time you find yourself in \[common situation\], remember \[concept or phenomenon\] and the importance of \[actions related to solution\].

\[Relatable text image to act as a ‘billboard’ for your post\]

## 18\. How to fix BROKEN thinking

Often, we run into problems because of faulty thinking. How we perceive the situation doesn’t align with what we want.

To truly understand your audience, get to know their beliefs. This way, when you speak with them, you can join the conversation already going on in their head.

By doing so, they’ll think, _“Ah, this person gets me”_– and they’ll be more receptive to what you have to say.

In line 2, Nicolas calls out a common misconception freelance writers have ( _“they think a retainer is a job for life”_). He then debunks this faulty thinking, reframing the problem, before giving his solution.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/N25U22zvKcqnO3kbIvzTukiX65I.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Why does \[specific audience\] face \[common problem\]?

Because they believe \[common misconception\].

Here’s my \[unique strategy\] to help you \[unlock desirable outcome\]:

The reality is, \[summarise why the problem exists\].

The secret lies in \[specific solution\].

Benefits of this approach include:

1. \[Benefit 1\]

2. \[Benefit 2\]

By adopting \[specific strategy\], you eliminate \[specific problem\] and \[unlock desirable outcome\].

Here’s how to think about it:

- \[Mental reframe/tip\]

- \[Mental reframe/tip\]

- \[Mental reframe/tip\]

So when you \[plan your strategy\], here are \[X\] things to consider:

- \[Strategic component 1\]

- \[Strategic component 2\]

- \[Strategic component 3\]

- \[Strategic component 4\]

- \[Strategic component 5\]

Here’s an example:

Instead of \[common approach\], try this:

- \[Strategic component 1 - example\]

- \[Strategic component 2 - example\]

- \[Strategic component 3 - example\]

- \[Strategic component 4 - example\]

- \[Strategic component 5 - example\]

\[Expand on why this method unlocks desirable outcomes\].

## 19\. Here’s a reality check for ya!

The reason this post evokes such a strong emotional reaction is due to _**negativity bias**_.

In short, we feel negative events much more intensely than positive events. It’s why mainstream news outlets lead with stories that foster a sense of outrage and despair.

_“If it bleeds, it leads”_ as the saying goes.

Whether we like it or not, negativity grabs attention. Notice how Sara uses negative language to evoke a strong emotional reaction from her reader, with terms like: “Lack,” “Mediocre,” “Broken,” and “Poor.”

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OarSPYbR7TC4xEGJEGKO79o5hII.png)

### Here’s the post template:

“\[Industry/Role\], \[unrealistic request\].”

X things \[Industry/Role\] can't fix:

1\. \[Common misunderstanding 1\] - \[Harsh truth\].

2\. \[Common misunderstanding 2\] - \[Harsh truth\].

3\. \[Common misunderstanding 3\] - \[Harsh truth\].

\[Industry/Role\] can achieve \[positive outcome\].

But it can't \[meet unrealistic expectations\].

Please remember this.

## 20\. How to champion a hero in a brand’s success story

Below, Alex shares how Abercrombie’s marketing team helped right a sinking ship with this simple 10-point storytelling framework:

1.  **Hook:** \[Brand\] achieved impressive result all because of \[Hero\]

2.  Previously, things were going great…

3.  \[Brand\] was doing X, Y, and Z and it was working…

4.  Until one day, it stopped working…

5.  They hit a low point…

6.  Because of that, \[Hero\] took action…

7.  \[Hero\] realised…

8.  So here’s what \[Hero\] did…

9.  Here’s the lesson…

10. Today, \[Brand\] is back to achieving great things…

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/lF7LPrgkn8nsS2qWLvpy7ZanPZk.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Brand's success story\] is a testament to \[key strategy\]. \[Impressive metric\].

Let's dive into the journey:

During \[time period\], \[Brand\] was at the peak of its game.

\[Mention specific achievement\].

Their strategy was simple: \[Original strategy\].

This approach worked great…

Until \[specific industry shift\] led to \[bad outcome\].

By \[date\], \[low point occurred\].

\[Brand\] decided to pivot.

\[Team/Business unit\] doubled down on \[alternative strategy\] after they realised \[key realisation\].

They implemented:

1\. \[Solution 1\]

2\. \[Solution 2\]

3\. \[Solution 3\]

The outcome? \[Brand\]'s renaissance is a story of \[relevant lesson\]

Many companies face \[common challenge\] because of \[industry shift\].

\[Brand\]'s story shows the importance of \[summarise solution\].

Now, \[Brand\] stands as a beacon of \[achieved goal\], with \[success metric\].

## 21\. Empower your reader to think differently

Society conditions us to chase the wrong things. Deep down we know something’s not right, but we fail to question it.

Fortunately, in this case, Neal’s done the research and thinking for us. He opens with a surprising statistic that grabs attention and lends weight to his argument.

He redefines how to think about the topic, challenging the societal narrative: that every business must sell for big money.

If you want to empower, enlighten and motivate your audience, try this simple post framework for yourself.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/y51rlPTBM9nlpYrVVfjlgbjjt7k.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Only \[a small fraction\] of \[specific initiatives/individuals\] \[achieve desirable outcome\].

You don’t have to follow \[typical definition of success\].

Define what success looks like for you.

Something you can look back on in \[time period\] from now with pride.

Perhaps that’s \[typical definition of success\].

Or \[alternative definition of success A\].

Or even \[alternative definition of success B\].

Whichever path you choose, you’re the one who decides.

## 22\. “You’ve been lied to. Here’s the truth…”

Harsh truths often go viral on social media because they’re bold, disruptive, and polarising. They evoke a strong emotional response.

You can either agree or disagree. There’s no middle ground.

Below, Courtney challenges the romantic idea that simply being “good enough” at a craft will get you noticed. She then clarifies that without self-promotion, this assumption is false.

To discover harsh truths about a topic, ask yourself (or ChatGPT):

_“What false assumptions do \[target audience\] make related to \[specific topic\]?”_

E.g. “What false assumptions do LinkedIn creators make related to posting content on the platform?”

Then reverse these assumptions and voilà… Lots of new content ideas.

### Here’s the post template:

\[Specific harsh truth\].

\[Necessary action/belief\] is essential to \[achieve desirable outcome\].

Whether that's \[example 1 of action to take\], or \[example 2 of action to take\].

If you don't \[take recommended action\], \[negative consequence\].

"\[Common but misguided belief\]"

\[Statement that rejects belief\].

The truth is \[impact of maintaining misguided belief\].

## 23\. “Hot off the press! Here’s what you need to know…”

Often, press releases for new products are:

- Too long

- Too boring

- And too hard to find

So if you have your finger on the pulse, there’s tremendous value in weeding out, distilling, and sharing the key takeaways.

Bonus points for doing so in a timely and engaging way like Rowan does below.

### Here’s the post template:

BREAKING: \[Short time period ago\], \[High-profile person/company/collaboration\] revealed \[new product/service/news\]

## 24\. How to boost your authority by association

Jesse pays homage to his friend and fellow collaborator, Niharikaa. He uses a charming, relatable story that boosts credibility for both of them by:

- Sharing the beats of their shared journey

- Mentioning successful collaborative efforts

- And referencing other prominent figures they’ve associated with

By endorsing Niharikaa, Jesse enhances her authority and his by association.

Being a LinkedIn creator can be lonely. That’s why teaming up with fellow creators (and championing them) can be so beneficial – for both parties. Who’s your Niharikaa?

### Here’s the post template:

\[Short time period ago\], I \[met/achieved significant milestone with\] \[description of the person – e.g. a rising star in the tech industry\]

We first connected in \[initial meeting context\] in \[year\].

Both of us \[description of initial common ground – e.g. aspiring entrepreneurs\].

\[Share an amusing anecdote or notable interaction during the early stages\].

\[Give any further context\]

We reconnected and \[what happened next\].

Then, \[describe a turning point or notable event/interaction\].

To date, we \[list shared accomplishments\].

And \[short time period ago\] we \[met/achieved significant milestone\].

I admire \[Person’s Name\] for their \[three personal qualities\].

They're the real deal and are destined for great things.

In fact, they \[list some of their notable solo accomplishments/things they’re working on\].

## 25\. To sell more, acknowledge and resolve objections

Jodie does a great job of putting potential customers at ease. Rather than ignoring a common objection people have, she raises it in the first line.

This hook also speaks directly to those interested in the topic.

Jodie then politely addresses their concerns, before mentioning how the product can be beneficial.

So if you sell a product, try this simple approach to knock more prospects off the fence.

### Here’s the post template:

“I don’t want \[common fear or misconception\].”

\[Reassure reader\]

Many \[target audience\] think \[new development in technology/method\] will \[lead to negative outcome\].

But don’t worry.

Because \[provide a new way to think about it\].

\- \[Briefly explain relevant feature\]

\[State high-level desirable outcome(s)\]

They're using \[Product Name\] to \[carry out action/achieve desirable outcome\].

\[Relevant thought-provoking question/Call to action\]

\[Image that matches the post\]

## 26\. Can you tell WHY this post went viral?

Here are 5 reasons:

1. Peep’s credibility as a “3x Founder” lends weight to his opinion

2. The hook is industry agnostic with broad appeal

3. The hook also features provocative language (“total crap” – 2x), which taps into _negativity bias\*\*_

4. Peep points out a glaring strategic oversight/frustration that will leave many readers nodding in agreement, eager for a solution

5. And lastly, he gives a solution that’s short, memorable, and actionable

_\*\*Negativity bias – people have a heightened awareness for potential threats, risks, or issues. As such, negative terms, perspectives, and frames are great attention-getters._

### Here’s the post template:

The difference between \[strategy A\] and \[strategy B\] is:

\[Key negative outcome associated with strategy B that’s often overlooked\].

For \[strategy A\], you get \[summarise key advantage\].

\[Share practical takeaway\].

## 27\. How to use analogies to make your point

Analogies are powerful literary devices. Use them to draw comparisons between two ideas, objects, or situations.

For example, Grace compares asking freelancers for free work with asking a tattoo artist for a free tattoo.

In essence, these two requests are the same (“Please can you work for free?”).

And while it’s common for freelancers to be asked this, the absurdity of this practice quickly becomes apparent when the same ask is made of tattoo artists.

Such is the power of analogies.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WGoPVavdVQ0olaZF4sZVaPwgLw.png)

### Here’s the post template:

“\[Common but controversial business practice posed as a statement by uninformed culprit\]”

Wait a minute.

You would never \[example of unfair practice occurring in another domain where it’s not the norm\].

You would \[list usual, fair behaviours\].

Why then do we see this as acceptable in \[industry/field\]?

Instead of \[unfair practice\], let’s focus on:

\- \[Alternative method/step 1\]

\- \[Alternative method/step 2\]

\- \[Alternative method/step 3\]

\- \[Alternative method/step 4\]

\[Highlight how the culprit may justify unfair practice\] \[then briefly dispute this justification\].

\[Concluding statement/takeaway\]

## 28\. Boost your credibility and relatability with shared experiences

Before outlining the problem and offering a solution, Justin hooks readers by relating with a common shared experience. Let’s break down what he does:

- First, he explicitly calls out who this post is for – “online entrepreneurs”

- He then mentions a common shared experience – “start their journey with freelancing”

- Next, he compliments the reader before revealing this was where he started, too

By saying he’s also been there and done that, Justin establishes a sense of relatability and trust.

As a result, his audience is more likely to keep reading and take his proposed solution more seriously.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Dskbq4jE3y2BgbA9AbfWiog.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Many \[target audience\] start \[at common starting point\].

And that makes sense.

But \[outline common growth challenge\].

This happens because \[reason for challenge\].

You may find yourself \[engaging in problematic actions\], which \[result in negative outcome\].

But there's a better way: \[proposed solution\].

\[Briefly define the solution\].

For example, take \[share a real-life example\].

\[Thought-provoking question for audience\]?

\[Related text image to act as a ‘billboard’ for your post\]

## 29\. The problem with attention-grabbing phrases

Below, Amanda points out the knock-on effects of jumping on content trends (like “hot takes”). By using trendy “attention-grabbing” phrases, you risk damaging your credibility.

Many creators fall into the trap of parroting the same phrases as others to boost engagement. Even though they know it doesn’t sound like something they’d say.

The problem is audiences quickly become desensitised to these cookie-cutter phrases, which leads to your content:

- Having less impact over time

- Being perceived as generic

- And eroding your reader’s trust

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/N0WAQi3rkmo36RjepsxRatC6zw.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Pose a common concern as a question\]?

\- \[Problematic trend 1\]

\- \[Problematic trend 2\]

\- \[Problematic trend 3\]

\[Briefly give your point of view\]

So rather than \[conduct misguided behaviour\], \[list recommended behaviours/strategies\].

Doing so will \[unlock these benefits\].

This approach is \[name or define approach/strategy\].

## 30\. The power of repeating yourself over and over and over again

Alex uses repetition to great effect. By repeating the same sentence structure 8x over, he:

- Reinforces the main idea of his post

- Builds rhythm and memorability

- Places greater emphasis on the proceeding solution

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/0IaHMs3rgi13gUSu7YAQizc5X0.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I \[achieved goal Y\] without \[common pre-requisite 3\].

I \[achieved goal Y\] without \[common pre-requisite 4\].

I \[achieved goal Y\] without \[common pre-requisite 5\].

To \[achieve goal Y\], all you really need to do is:

1\. \[Core action 1 for achieving goal\].

2\. \[Core action 2 for achieving goal\].

3\. Rinse and repeat (many times).

Everything else is just a distraction.

\[Image that matches the post\]

## 31\. Remember to document your journey

- When did you start creating content?

- When did you reach 1,000 followers? 10,000 followers?

- How long did it take to get your first customer through LinkedIn?

Keep a timeline of significant events that occur in your growth as a creator.

Whether you journal, mark things on your calendar, or simply keep a list in a Google Doc  – it doesn’t matter.

Document your journey. Take photos and screenshots. Then, in time, refer back to these moments in your content to see how far you've come.

## 32\. Why 3 is the magic number

The rule of three is a powerful principle in communication. You see it everywhere, from stories to films, ads to poems, images, music, even LinkedIn posts.

- The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

- The beginning, middle, and end

- Snap! Crackle! Pop!

Studies show grouping information in 3s is more memorable, rhythmic, and satisfying to read.

Below, Eric uses the rule of 3 several times throughout his post to great effect.

### Here’s the post template:

Here’s how they do it:

1. They \[positive trait or action with explanation 1\]

2. They \[positive trait or action with explanation 2\]

## 33\. Borrow credibility to get attention

Many creators fail to get attention because people don’t trust what they say.

Question:

_Who are you more likely to take writing advice from – someone with 342 followers or Steven King?_

As it happens, Liz has a lot more than 342 followers. But leveraging the expertise of well-known authorities is a great way to drive engagement.

In fact, it’s a great way to grow your audience when you don’t yet have impressive results of your own to share.

\[Offer an actionable takeaway\]

## 34\. Why being vulnerable is relatable

Social media is full of people sharing highlights. The best bits.

But no one is perfect. Life, business, LinkedIn – none of these things are easy. We all struggle. And by sharing these struggles with others, you elicit a sense of camaraderie and compassion.

Chances are, if you struggle with something, many others will feel the same. By saying so, you help your reader feel seen.

### Here’s the post template:

I’ve been in \[engaging in new action\] for \[time period\] and I \[vulnerable admission\].

- \[Action 1\]

- \[Action 2\]

- \[Action 3\]

\[Share a final thought or reflection\]

\[End with an encouraging message\]

## 35\. Reinforce what people already believe

John taps into the power of _confirmation bias_, which describes our tendency to notice and agree with information that fits our existing beliefs.

Marketers who aspire to be “the most valuable asset” will nod in agreement while reading John’s post.

The final sentence then suggests that having someone like this (or being someone like this) provides a team with an “unfair advantage.” This evokes an air of scarcity, which makes the qualities identified seem even more desirable.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/7r0UKVKm8B5GqaxrbfsUbGuGtB0.png)

### Here’s the post template:

The most important \[specific asset/trait/quality\] any \[target audience\] can have is an \[asset/person/team/strategy/tool\] who/that \[prioritises desirable trait/quality\].

\[Summarise the advantage or importance of having such an asset/person/team/strategy/tool\].

## 36\. The pain of losing > The pleasure of gaining

Loss aversion is a powerful cognitive bias that plays on our emotions. In other words, the pain of losing something far exceeds the pleasure of gaining something of equal value.

This means we’ll go to great lengths to protect what we own. So when Jake draws attention to the possibility of losing your social media accounts, people take notice.

## 37\. How to get people to take action!

There’s no shortage of actionable advice on LinkedIn.

Whether it’s steps, tactics, frameworks – you name it.

The problem is, most readers will not take action on your advice. Especially if you fail to give them at least one good reason why they should.

Often, these reasons are posed as desirable benefits, results, and/or outcomes.

Below, Lara includes 4 reasons why the reader should follow her advice:

1. “If you want leads…” (benefit)

2. “If you want conversion…” (benefit)

3. “If you want to double your visibility…” (benefit)

4. Her “most successful” clients all follow these steps (credibility)

So next time you share actionable advice, include some compelling _reasons why_ your reader should take action.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/oLoIIN0JepPvI7cY0tKT9YpBq8s.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I’ve worked with \[impressive number\] of \[relevant professionals/clients\].

Here’s how they \[achieve desirable outcome\]:

\[Summarise key principle or rule\].

1. \[Actionable step\]

2. \[Actionable step\]

3. \[Actionable step\]

4. \[Actionable step\]

This is how you \[reach specific goal\] without \[common pre-requisite\].

- If you want \[benefit A\], then \[take action A\]

- If you want \[benefit B\], then \[take actionB\]

- If you want \[benefit C\], then \[take action C\]

Simple, effective, repeatable.

Apply these steps for \[time period\], and watch what happens.

## 38\. Share your wins, then tease future value…

David leads with a successful outcome: “We sold our startup for 7 figures 🥂”

This implies he’s someone worth listening to. Then, by teasing more “lessons” towards the end of his post, David fosters a sense of intrigue that’ll have readers coming back for more.

3 quick takeaways:

- Don’t shy away from sharing your wins. Be bold. People love a success story

- Don’t get lost in the details. Set the context quickly, then get to the point

- Focus on ONE key lesson, then tease more lessons to come

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/HPJhTzu7HKhJzhWuEP8shu4dkM.png)

## 39\. How to give an honest, unbiased review

As with many exciting new technologies, there are often two sides to the story. While AI tools offer many benefits, Ruben doesn’t sugarcoat it. He addresses an obvious objection many readers will have, namely:

_“Won’t this lead to ‘monstrous waves of similar, unoriginal content’?”_

By doing so, Ruben achieves 3 things:

1. He empathises with their concerns, building trust

2. He shares his point of view, boosting his authority

3. And he fosters engagement from his audience

## 41\. What’s the goal of your post?

Before you post anything, get clear on what outcome(s) you’re looking to achieve.

Adrian’s post achieves 2 key things:

1. He encourages the reader to build a personal brand.

2. He also builds trust for his brand (by showcasing impressive results).

So when writing content, think about your reader:

- What action do you want them to take?

- What should they take away?

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/oLF6Au7uAUwegbZ5YqEVjMNorY.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Don’t \[common practice/action\].

Getting people to read your posts is great. But…

Getting them to read AND _think_ about your posts is even better!

How do you do this?

With rhetorical questions, that’s how. There are 2 in this section, and below Courtney uses 6.

Rhetorical questions are useful because reading is a relatively passive activity compared to thinking. By posing questions to your reader, you engage more of their brain.

Your words become more impactful, more memorable.

## 46\. How to harness “The Bandwagon Effect”

Picture this: You have a choice between 2 restaurants.

Both are unfamiliar to you.

So you open up Google Maps to get more intel:

- Restaurant A - has 7 reviews (some good, some bad)

- Restaurant B - has 220+ reviews (most are great)

Which do you choose?

Pretty easy, right? The bandwagon effect is a mental shortcut. It helps us quickly evaluate whether a habit, behaviour, or belief is worth adopting or not – based on the support it receives from others.

By calling out the popularity of his podcast, Kipp harnesses this powerful cognitive bias.

In turn, people will be more willing to give his podcast a listen. Thereby fueling even more podcast growth.

## 47\. A good twist keeps ‘em reading

Great storytellers _subvert our expectations_. This storytelling device helps keep the reader engaged, wondering what will happen next.

In contrast, you risk losing the reader if your stories are too predictable.

- Joe starts his story by outlining the challenges he faced on his 27th birthday.

- Next, he subverts our expectations by foreshadowing what’s to come ( _“But this isn’t a negative post about the grind”. It’s actually a positive post.”_)

- He then divulges some positive aspects of the story.

Joe transforms what seems like a post about the gruelling nature of entrepreneurship into one about flexibility and personal fulfilment.

Herein lies the power of subverting expectations.

\[Briefly expand on how you _think_ about facing such challenges\]

\[Share an inspiring takeaway\]

Here’s a tip: \[Practical tip\]

\[Include relevant image/image hook\]

## 48\. What does your hook imply?

Tarana’s hook: _“I’ve been on LinkedIn for 8 months now.”_

On the surface, this hook doesn’t state anything of great value. It simply gives some context and a timeframe.

But if we read between the lines, these words imply that within a short period of time, Tarana has gained something of value to share.

And by immediately following up with a list of impressive achievements, she cements herself as an authority in the reader’s mind, before sharing some practical advice.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wX6QcN5Evat6SDb8prSaAJLWo.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I’ve \[engaged in action/role/platform/context\] for \[timeframe\].

In which time, I’ve:

- \[Achievement 1\]

- \[Achievement 2\]

- \[Achievement 3\]

Here’s what I didn’t do:

- \[Common tactic 1\]

- \[Common tactic 2\]

- \[Common tactic 3\]

Instead, I did this:

- \[Effective strategy 1\]

- \[Effective strategy 2\]

- \[Effective strategy 3\]

- \[Effective strategy 4\]

- \[Effective strategy 5\]

So don’t just \[follow the common advice\].

\[Briefly summarise your overall effective strategy from above\]

PS. \[Relevant thought-provoking question for audience\]?

\[Include relevant image/image hook\]

## 49\. Here’s another attention-getting tool…

Did you know: someone held their breath underwater for 25 minutes?

Croatian Freediver Budimir Šobat held his breath for a whopping 24m 37s in 2021. Crazy!

Surprising facts tap into our love of novelty. To grab attention, Noah lists 3 surprising facts that also feature well-known companies (another element LinkedIn loves).

### Here’s the post template:

\[Surprising Fact or Misconception 1\]

\[Surprising Fact or Misconception 2\]

\[Surprising Fact or Misconception 3\]

I \[experienced relevant setback\] before I \[achieved relevant success\].

\[Motivational insight and/or practical takeaway\]

## 50\. The dark side of LinkedIn

As Jane mentions, LinkedIn is still social media.

While there’s value in sharing your achievements, take what people say with a pinch of salt. And more importantly, don’t let all the success stories discourage you.

In general, people post more highlights than lowlights. You’ll never get the full picture from LinkedIn alone.

On the bright side, though, LinkedIn is (by far) the most positive and supportive social media platform out there.

So if you’re just getting started as a creator, LinkedIn is the place to be!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/oJjoh4NjEYlFPAiUIzfGKSY.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Hint at deceptive behaviour on platform/industry/context\].

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy \[platform/industry/context\].

But there is a dark side.

For example, sometimes I see:

- \[Negative/deceptive behaviour 1\]

- \[Negative/deceptive behaviour 2\]

- \[Negative/deceptive behaviour 3\]

So if you \[engage on platform/industry/context\], and you’re \[negatively impacted\]...

Remember, \[positive/inspiring takeaway\].

\[Include relevant image/image hook\]

## 51\. What to say when your reader’s heard it all before…

Lara uses an advanced marketing tactic here known as _‘Naming the Mechanism_. _’_

Rather than saying: “This is the ‘Personal Brand Growth’ Strategy.”

**↳** She says: _“This is the ‘IRL to disrupt URL’ Strategy.”_

By doing so, her advice becomes unique, interesting.

Nowadays, there’s no shortage of people giving ‘personal branding’ advice. Problem is, the reader’s heard it all before.

So to counteract this, Lara applies a new lick of paint to her guidance by giving her personal branding strategy a unique name. One that’s catchy and memorable.

She then heightens her reader’s desire to know more by saying, _“I’ve never seen this explained ever, so pay attention!”_ – which further builds a sense of exclusivity.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/HsQcw5wAEp9bfFB2fAlCUFrS8c.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I \[started endeavour\] in \[time period\].

(Steal my method for \[achieving desirable outcome\])

It's not just about \[common assumption\].

It's about using “\[unique strategy name\]” to \[achieve goal\].

After \[doing a significant amount of research/analysis\], here’s how \[eminent figures/companies get desirable results\]:

\- \[Mission/Aim 1\]

\- \[Mission/Aim 2\]

\- \[Mission/Aim 3\]

\[Briefly reinforce/explain points from above\].

\[Statement that transitions to actionable advice\]:

\- \[Strategy/Tactic 1\]

\- \[Strategy/Tactic 2\]

\- \[Strategy/Tactic 3\]

For example:

\[Give example(s) – if appropriate\]

\[Additional insight/tip\]

\[Key takeaway\]

PS. \[Call to action or question for audience\]

\[Image that matches the post\]

## 52\. Every post is a seed

Many creators love to preach about staying consistent.

However, the most consistent creators all work smarter, not harder.

How? By repurposing, that’s how.

Below, Nejc shares his method for leaning on content he’s already written to fuel the creation of other content assets.

The best thing about posting on LinkedIn is the quick (and free) audience feedback.

Use this feedback to inform what to include in your newsletter, emails, ads, landing pages etc.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Vab0tirQ0xxyd6d89oZxyocKLL0.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Your \[topic/idea/owned asset\] is a \[valuable asset\] you can \[exploit/benefit from\].

Over the last \[short time period\], I’ve been \[doing a lot of key action\].

- \[Specific task relevant to key action\]

- \[Specific task relevant to key action\]

- \[Specific task relevant to key action\]

It’s all I do every \[time of day/week\].

My \[topic/idea/owned asset\] has been a lifesaver.

And the best thing about \[doing key action\] is that it:

- \[Unlocks short-term benefit\]

- \[Unlocks short-term benefit\]

- \[Unlocks short-term benefit\]

\[Bold statement that reinforces the positive impact of doing key action\].

Plus if you \[take this additional key action\] you can:

- \[Unlock this longer-term benefit\]

- \[Unlock this longer-term benefit\]

- \[Unlock this longer-term benefit\]

So remember to \[summarise your perspective/reiterate key message\].

PS. \[Call to action or question for audience\]

\[Relatable text image to act as a ‘billboard’ for your post\]

## 53\. Catching your reader off-guard

The ability to speak well in public is a highly sought-after skill. So when Morgan claims to have worked with an acting coach to improve this skill, people pay attention.

Why? Because this approach is unusual.

And unusual is interesting.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JSfTbPRd27klciipdMGJ68GcmRk.png)

### Here’s the post template:

My secret for \[achieving goal\]?

\[Unconventional solution\].

\[Anticipate the reader’s scepticism or confusion\].

But hear me out.

I \[describe what you did initially – first steps\].

\[Key reason(s) for decision\].

\[Describe what happened next\].

The results have been amazing!

- \[Impressive result/benefit gained\]

- \[Impressive result/benefit gained\]

- \[Impressive result/benefit gained\]

\[Summarise key benefit\].

\[Give a brief anecdote that relates to your experience engaging with the solution/authority\].

When I \[did relevant activity\], I \[experienced/gained\]:

- \[Desirable outcome/positive feedback\].

- \[Desirable outcome/positive feedback\].

- \[Desirable outcome/positive feedback\].

Here’s the lesson:

## 54.  Why “going viral” shouldn’t be the goal

While Jess refers to B2B companies, her advice applies more broadly.

Ultimately, the main goal of posting on LinkedIn is to market your offer to people who are prepared to buy what you sell.

But unfortunately: Likes ≠ Cash! These are vanity metrics.

Yes, you want more eyeballs on your content… But remember, you want more of the _right_ eyeballs. Not eyeballs for the sake of eyeballs.

Ok, that’s a lot of eyeballs. Take it away, Jess…

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/yCalKk9mr0IZ17JTG8wV9PsyCAg.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Target audience\]: you don’t want your \[asset/output\] to “\[common misconception\].”

Instead, you want it to \[vivid metaphor that describes what asset/output should be like\].

In other words:

- \[Specific characteristic that describes what asset/output should be like\]

- \[Specific characteristic that describes what asset/output should be like\]

- \[Specific characteristic that describes what asset/output should be like\]

Or you risk \[negative consequence(s) occuring\].

Here are X ways/steps to \[achieve desirable outcome\]:

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

\[Key takeaway\].

## 55\. Unsure how to structure your next LinkedIn post? Try this…

Kevin uses every copywriter’s favourite writing framework – the PAS formula.

Here’s how he uses it:

1. First, he calls out the **Problem**: “Most sales follow-ups I see are painful to read.”

2. He then **Agitates** the problem by challenging a common misconception, before citing common mistakes people make.

3. And lastly, Kevin provides a list of actionable tips as a **Solution**.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/qe69j5CKLy0TsCG86DpROrxfg.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Most \[common activity/assets\] I see are \[negative descriptor\].

\[Target audience\], you must keep this in mind:

\[Key insight\].

The \[activity/asset\] is NOT for \[incorrect assumption\].

It's for \[correct assumption\].

These are the common mistakes I often see:

- \[Mistake\]

- \[Mistake\]

- \[Mistake\]

Here’s how to \[achieve goal\]:

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

- \[Actionable insight/step\]

And always remember to \[crucial step/action\].

This way, you can \[achieve desirable outcome\] \[easier/faster/cheaper\].

## 56\. This is one of the hardest hooks to nail (here’s why)

Below, Erika puts words to an _unvoiced_ issue.

But nailing this hook type isn’t easy. Not only do you have to be an eloquent wordsmith, but also an astute observer of your field – with your finger on the pulse.

The aim here is to leave your reader thinking…

_“Finally, someone said it!”_

Here are some of the comments:

- “Shame I can only hit the like button once.”

- “Erika, you forgot to add… mic drop.”

- “This is real, table-flipping talk.”

- “So true!”

- “YES!”

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/F7fvaHEIkMbYHwfjP0vxT6VRiU.png)

### Here’s the post template:

If your \[organisation/department/team\] isn't ready to \[desired change or action\], all the \[common practice or resource\] in the world won't matter.

## 57\. Is your account growing? If so, do this intermittently…

Recent followers likely won’t know much about you. They may have seen a post of yours, clicked follow, then forgotten all about you.

So, periodically re-introduce yourself like Taylin does. Get your new followers up to speed. Share with them:

- Who you are and where you’re from

- Relatable challenges you’ve faced

- Pivotal moments in your journey

- Relevant accomplishments

- Your business/creator goal

And remind them of what topics and content types you touch on.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TEBqIGs57gEgdfWcRLLeyupnw.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I began my journey in \[field/industry\] \[time period\] ago.

Hi, I’m \[Your Name\].

Originally from \[Original Location\], I now live in \[Current Location\].

My background includes \[time period\] in \[industry or field\] – specialising in \[specific skills or areas\].

I had no prior knowledge of \[new skill or field\] when I started.

But after \[time period\], things began to pick up:

\- \[Key achievement/benefit unlocked\]

\- \[Key achievement/benefit unlocked\]

\- \[Key achievement/benefit unlocked\]

Now, I’m focused on \[current goal or business focus\].

Along the way, I offer \[type of advice or service you provide\].

\[Additional interesting personal fact\]

\[A quirky or engaging question to engage reader\]

\[Call to action\]

\[Image that matches the post\]

## 58\. How to put yourself into your reader’s shoes

Just giving sound advice isn’t enough. To convince your reader you’re worth listening to, you must anticipate their doubts, frustrations, and objections.

Filipa’s secret to writing content that converts is _“\[Giving\] all your secrets away for free”_ – provocative advice.

To counteract any scepticism, she immediately anticipates and then handles an obvious objection that arises. This shows Filipa understands her audience, evoking trust.

### Here’s the post template:

The secret to \[taking specific action\] that \[unlocks desirable outcome\]:

\[Counterintuitive tip/strategy\].

“\[Common objection posed as a question\]?”

\[Yes or No\].

Here’s why:

\[List reasons that clearly alleviate the objection from above\].

\[Briefly explain your experience using counterintuitive tip/strategy, and the benefits you (or others) have derived\].

“\[Guiding question that helps ascertain whether counterintuitive tip/strategy is working\]?”

\[Key takeaway\].

\[Image that matches the post\]

## 59\. How to offer an irresistible solution

Anyone can point out a problem and then offer a solution.

But what sets experts apart from non-experts is their ability to identify problems and clearly explain their reasoning, before giving a solution.

Here, not only does Robert identify a flawed approach, but he:

- Demonstrates the ineffectiveness of said practice with examples

- Explains why it’s ineffective

- Then states why it persists

… all before he gives a solution. The takeaway?

Don’t just challenge the status quo. First, explain why the normal way of doing things is broken. Then offer your _unique_ solution.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PtcKQ6uunBwOgobLa3YV1HKsDQQ.png)

### Here’s the post template:

If I had to describe \[common industry/topical issue\] in one word:

I’d say “\[chosen word\].”

Just look at \[examples from industry/field\], and you'll see:

\- \[Specific example from ineffective practice\]

\- \[Specific example from ineffective practice\]

\- \[Specific example from ineffective practice\]

\[Give your opinion/Brief assessment\]

\[Explain the implications of said practice and/or why it persists\].

This is why \[Partner’s Name/Group/Company\] and I offer \[a different approach\]:

\- \[Key feature or approach 1\]

\- \[Key feature or approach 2\]

\- \[Key feature or approach 3\]

We're cutting through the \[original issue/chosen word\] so you can \[unlock desirable outcome\].

## 60\. The nightmare behind a shiny facade (a lesson in storytelling)

Below, Greg gives a masterclass on how to tell an engaging story.

In particular, notice how he paints vivid pictures using:

- Iconic symbols of wealth ( _“Living the high life in SF with a crazy house and Porsche 911.”_)

- Metaphor ( _“drowning in VC money but feeling like teenage toddlers trying to figure it out.”_)

- Evocative language ( _“The unicorn dream is cracking, and people are waking up.”)_

- _Analogy (“The air is thick with anxiety.”)_

This approach to storytelling is not just informative, but deeply immersive.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XQnn0ycpoLvUrNVPl8dbwrbHqo.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Ever wondered what lies behind the glittering façade of \[industry/profession/role\]?

Let me take you behind the scenes.

\[Short time ago\], I spoke with \[describe person and their impressive credentials\].

From the outside, \[brief description of their success and lifestyle\].

But here's what you don't see:

\[Share a vulnerable admission/predicament they’re in\].

Despite \[brief description of achievements\], they're facing \[key challenges\].

Here’s what they said:

"\[Direct quote from the conversation\]"

This story isn't unique.

It's the untold reality many face in \[industry/profession\], where \[brief description of common misconceptions\].

I've \[walked this path myself/seen it unfold like this before\].

Sometimes, \[positive outcomes\].

But often, \[common negative outcomes\].

Then one day, you realise \[reflective thought or decision\].

For those feeling the same, looking for \[what the reader might be seeking\], I’ve created something for you. Check out this \[resource/tool/link\]: \[Link\]

_**\*\*Note: Avoid revealing the identity (or any sensitive details) of any individuals without their consent.**_

## 61\. The secret to writing content that hits the dopamine button

The best creators don’t just educate. They seek to make the reader feel something.

Learning of “novel” ideas induces a flood of dopamine (the “feel-good” hormone) in our brains.

“A novel idea is one that's not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and worthwhile.” – Julian Shapiro

Below, Sahil shares a novel, counter-intuitive idea (i.e. Happiness is a byproduct of struggle, not ease), leaving the reader thinking: “Oh, I’ve never thought of it that way.”

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jdPNcrauPOUzhTy5UzfDeMPEm0.png)

### Here’s the post template:

“\[Provocative statement that challenges a common belief\].”

\[Truth that contradicts the common belief\].

\[Briefly elaborate on core idea\].

\- \[Example of action related to truth 1\]

\- \[Example of action related to truth 2\]

\- \[Example of action related to truth 3\]

\- \[Example of action related to truth 4\]

\- \[Example of action related to truth 5\]

\[Personal observation or insight – eg. about people who have embraced the truth and succeeded\].

\[Key takeaway\].

\[Call to action or question for audience\].

## 62\. How to add emphasis with anaphora

“Anaphora: repetition of a word or expression at the beginning of successive phrases, clauses, sentences, or verses especially for rhetorical or poetic effect.” (Merriam-Webster)

Wes uses this literary device to great effect (“Before you…” - x6).

Use anaphora in your own writing to:

- Create rhythm

- Give emphasis

- Link, compare, or contrast ideas

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/gS5lGQrIWH6jjvkREsnWeQiIWs0.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Expert or Influential Person\] said, “\[Relevant Quote\].”

In other words: \[Paraphrase the quote for clarity\].

Before you \[common negative response/action\], \[alternative positive action\].

Before you \[common negative response/action\], \[alternative positive action\].

Before you \[common negative response/action\], \[alternative positive action\].

Before you \[common negative response/action\], \[alternative positive action\].

When I \[feel/encounter negative emotion or situation\], I \[ask myself: “Question to encourage positive action?” OR conduct key positive action\].

## 63\. The power of emotionally-charged phrases

Trevor’s hook is a phrase that most job seekers will be familiar with: “We’ve decided to move forward with other candidates.”

These 8 words immediately conjure a sense of frustration. They’re instantly recognisable. No other context is needed.

This hook quickly piques reader curiosity, compelling them to read on to ease the tension these words impart.

To uncover similar emotionally charged phrases for your content, ask ChatGPT to:

"Generate a list of 20 emotionally-charged phrases commonly experienced by \[target audience\] in \[specific context\], focusing on those that evoke strong reactions like disappointment, frustration, or relief."

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Nen3M2eYsCK2CrKJLXDYBlClriA.png)

### Here’s the post template:

“\[Common negative feedback/phrase\].”

If you’ve been \[related activity\], you will have heard this.

It \[causes specific negative impact/emotion\].

It \[causes specific negative impact/emotion\] when \[specific situation\].

It \[causes specific negative impact/emotion\] more when \[more detailed situation\].

\[Relevant harsh truth\].

But it \[causes specific negative impact/emotion\] less when you realise:

\- \[Reassuring point/new perspective 1\]

\- \[Reassuring point/new perspective 2\]

\- \[Reassuring point/new perspective 3\]

\[Personal anecdote related to narrative\].

If you’ve faced \[specific negative impact/emotion\] lately, please know \[reassuring statement\].

\[Briefly expand on reassuring statement from above\].

Keep \[taking positive action 1\].

Keep \[taking positive action 2\].

Keep \[taking positive action 3\].

\[Powerful concluding statement\].

\[Image hook that reinforces core message\]

## 64\. How to switch the reader from passive skimmer to active thinker

Rather than just spell things out, encourage the reader to reflect on what you’ve said.

End your post with a relevant question that helps people internalise the core message you wish to convey.

Like Alex does: “Which company would you be most likely to buy from?”

Asking rhetorical questions not only gets peoples’ minds firing at a higher clip, making your content more memorable – but it can also lead to more comments and post engagement.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/8UMvEOWYREF0gKwy8iJJyfiTDfo.png)

### Here’s the post template:

If \[target audience\] want to \[achieve desirable outcome\], then they need to do this:

They need to \[main action or principle\].

How?

By \[Distill main action or principle into a short concept\].

For example:

\[Give a hypothetical scenario that puts the prescriptive advice from above into context\].

\[Question to encourage reader to internalise core message\]?

\[Image hook or relevant quote from an authority figure\]

## 65\. Nobody cares about your content? Try this…

“Strategic content curation allows you to get in front of a larger audience from day one. It gives you the attention and credibility you need to attract organic followers.” – Josue Valles

But…

Avoid just sharing other people’s content. When you curate, the key is to add value.

For example, Nathan gives quick descriptions and interesting insights for each book he recommends.

By curating valuable resources, you’re saving the reader time. You’re effectively saying, “Hey, I’ve read/watched/listened to tonnes of \[resources\] like this. Here’s a great list to help you \[achieve desirable outcome\]...”

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/0hBoM7aZAM5jDsRJlhhru5MBNTI.png)

### Here’s the post template:

X \[valuable resources\] to \[unlock specific desirable outcome\]:

1\. \[Resource 1\] by \[Creator/Author/Authority\]

\[Brief description of resource, why it’s recommended, and an interesting insight\].

2\. \[Resource 2\] by \[Creator/Author/Authority\]

\[Brief description of resource, why it’s recommended, and an interesting insight\].

3\. \[Resource 3\] by \[Creator/Author/Authority\]

\[Brief description of resource, why it’s recommended, and an interesting insight\].

4\. \[Resource 4\] by \[Creator/Author/Authority\]

\[Brief description of resource, why it’s recommended, and an interesting insight\].

5\. \[Resource 5\] by \[Creator/Author/Authority\]

\[Brief description of resource, why it’s recommended, and an interesting insight\].

\[Tease upcoming content or call to action to engage readers further\].

## 66\. Tapping into the human desire to belong

For millennia, groups of humans have worked together as a means to survive.

We have a powerful psychological need to belong.

And while most of us no longer live in tribes, we all strive to identify with specific groups of people. Studies show it’s crucial for maintaining happiness.

Psychologists have identified 3 over-arching group types – that all groups fall into regardless of purpose:

1. Aspirational – groups to which you’d like to belong

2. Associative – groups that share your ideals and values

3. Dissociative – groups you do not wish to belong **\*\***

Below, Matt refers to an aspirational group when he says:

“The biggest and best founders in the world all realise that social copywriting is a massively high leverage skill.”

Thereby raising the perceived value of copywriting as a must-learn skill for any ambitious founder.

**\*\*This insight was found in the book ‘Cashvertising’ by Drew Eric Whitman**

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/mzSAZP6eS3E6oUJ4h3ClnMwsf0.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Quick reminder: \[Skill/Habit/Routine\] isn't JUST for \[expected group\].

\[Aspirational group\] all know that \[skill/habit/routine\] is \[relevant descriptor\].

They use it \[list/briefly explain key benefit(s)\].

It takes \[relevant investment\] to \[learn/implement/benefit from\] \[skill/habit/routine\].

But if you \[understand/follow these steps\]:

- \[Fundamental/Step 1\]

- \[Fundamental/Step 2\]

- \[Fundamental/Step 3\]

Then you can \[unlock desirable outcome(s)\].

\[Personal sign-off\].

\[Call to action\].

\[Include relevant image/image hook\]

## 67\. No one can argue with your personal experiences

To validate your advice, weave in personal experiences

Sharing relevant personal stories and anecdotes shows the reader you’re speaking from experience. You go from a stilted college professor reciting theory from a textbook, to a trusted professional who’s walked the path.

To avoid coming across like some stuffy expert, simply tell people how you (or others) went from A to B.

And be honest about the challenges and mistakes. Doing so helps make your content more relatable, and any advice you give more impactful.

Here, Noemi shares a personal story of struggle and realisation:

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wEtPG9QF1DBZYTd1k7Ni7PsY.png)

### Here’s the post template:

If you’re a \[target audience\], your main task is to \[core responsibility\].

It took me \[significant time period\] to learn this.

When I first started \[relevant activity\], I was:

- \[Task 1\]

- \[Task 2\]

- \[Task 3\]

I worked X hours a day.

But \[undesirable outcome\].

It was \[emotional response\].

\[Briefly expand on the problem\].

And then I realised…

\[Key realisation\].

\[Rhetorical question that relates to problem\]?

So, I \[changed my approach or took decisive action\]

\[Briefly explain new approach/action taken\].

And that’s how I \[unlocked desirable outcome\].

Because the truth is:

\[Harsh truth\].

\[Key takeaway\].

\[Question to foster engagement and/or Call to action\].

\[Include relevant image/image hook\]

## 68\. One of the greatest gifts you can give the reader

Shine a light on the limiting beliefs holding them back.

“Limiting beliefs are false beliefs that prevent us from pursuing our goals and desires.” – Mark Manson

“What are the most common limiting beliefs holding creators back from building a $100,000 creator business?”

This is likely the question Jon asked himself, his audience, and/or ChatGPT before writing this post.

For the reader to engage with your products and services, they must first believe they can achieve the result you’re promising.

To get them there, do what Jon does below: Expose, then debunk their faulty beliefs.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jOPhCBSWdqymfBgaIwfyVJtjitg.png)

### Here’s the post template:

This is a terrible mindset for \[target audience\]:

(It held me back for \[time period\])

\[Briefly explain/list limiting belief(s)\].

Because here’s the thing…

In \[current year\], \[motivating statement\].

Zoom out:

\[Include one or more supporting facts or statistics\].

\[Inspiring takeaway\].

\[Include relevant image/image hook\]

## 69\. How to imply you’re an expert

Here’s how Ash enhances his credibility as a personal branding expert:

- He draws attention to a flawed, self-serving approach to doing business (i.e. engaging with prospects)

- He references and critiques a well-known marketing strategy (Gary Vee’s "Jab Jab Jab, Right Hook")

- He highlights his commitment to long-term, sustainable practices with his concluding statement ("Brand isn't a 30-second TV ad. It’s a lifetime campaign")

Ash’s personal story, critical analysis, and concise takeaway showcases his expertise and implies good values. Thought leadership at its best.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/kjzDgvwbvC6bzeNWKVuPdX8z7Xc.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I remember a \[person/scenario\] who/that used to \[supportive/beneficial action\].

\[Person/Scenario\] used to \[key action\].

But then \[things stopped or resulted in a negative outcome\].

It's because \[prior action/event that initiated this change\].

\[Briefly expand on what happened to conclude the story\].

See a lot of \[target audience\] subscribe to the \[common strategy/action\].

But here’s the thing…

\[Give your unique perspective/challenge how this strategy/action is implemented\].

\[Statement that ties your perspective back to the initial story\].

\[Key takeaway\].

## 70\. How to write posts that sound like music

Ever read content that sounds robotic?

With sentences all the same length?

Where the writing sounds flat and boring?

If so, follow Henneke’s lead.

Apply these tips to inject rhythm into your writing:

- Vary sentence length

- Cut long sentences in two

- Pepper in 1-3 word sentences

- Give yourself permission to start sentences with Or, And, But, or Because

“Create a sound that pleases the reader’s ear. Don’t just write words. Write music.” – Gary Provost

## 71\. You’ve been lied to (here’s the truth…)

Did you know:

The more times you hear a lie repeated, the more likely you are to believe it?

This is known as the Illusory Truth Effect.

Online, it’s easy for misinformation to spread. The media sway the public with political propaganda. Fake news stories claim events that never happened. And businesses protect sober realities with sugar-coated statements.

Below, Guillaume reveals the stark truth behind 10 commonly told startup lies.

No one likes being deceived. On hearing you’ve been misled, you’ll likely have a strong desire to seek out the truth – which explains why Guillaume’s post attracts readers like moths to a flame.

## 72\. How to dispel false beliefs (that stop people from buying)

What false beliefs prevent your prospective customers from desiring your product or service?

For example:

**Misconception:** "The more features a CRM has, the better it is."

**The truth:** Too many features can overwhelm your team. As a result, adoption rates are lower. Instead, prioritise a user-friendly solution that offers the right features for your business.

\\_\\_\\\*

**Misconception:** "Online education is inferior to in-person learning."

**The truth:** Online education offers higher flexibility, access to diverse resources, and interactive tools that enhance the learning experience.

For every product or service, there’ll be a handful of common objections. So, keep a list of all the questions your prospects ask in relation to what you sell. Then use facts, stats, and benefits to dispel any false beliefs your prospects may hold – like Dina does below.

## 73\. Stoke the fire of your reader’s imagination

Here, Josh lays out a hypothetical “What if” scenario involving Steve Jobs. In doing so, he:

- Leverages Steve’s authority to grab attention

- Engages the reader’s imagination by painting a real-life sales interaction (with dialogue)

- Explains a key sales technique using a well-known product (an iPod)

This approach makes it easy for the reader to picture the scenario in their head – like a mental movie.

By speaking to careers, business, and artistry—in his image hook—Charles broadens the appeal of his post.

This serves to capture the attention of a wider audience. The reader will read this image hook first, before reading his specific business wins in the post description.

The takeaway? To maximise reach, reference topics, domains, and ideas that have broad appeal in your image hook. Then, once you have people’s attention, get more specific about your experiences and area of expertise in your post description.

## 75\. Going mega-viral (8 tips)

Dora’s post went mega-viral with 23K+ likes and thousands of comments and reposts.

Here are 8 reasons why:

1. **Her post appeals to a broad audience** (i.e. not just leaders, but anyone familiar with a corporate working environment)

2. **Her post topic has strong emotional appeal** (i.e. advocating for work-life balance and respect for employees)

3. **Her hook challenges traditional notions** of leadership, which grabs attention and sparks debate

4. **She keeps her first 7 lines short and sharp.** This quickly draws the reader into her post, before she uses any longer sentences.

5. **She uses vivid visual elements** **(i.e. emojis as signposts) and lists**, which makes her content easy to skim.

6. **She doesn’t just keep her advice high-level** (e.g. “Recognize efforts,” “Encourage flexibility” etc.), she also gives specific practical advice on how to accomplish these high-level directives.

7. **She borrows credibility** from Adam Grant, a recognised expert, to reinforce her message.

8. **And lastly, Dora encourages people to “Repost to promote healthier work cultures.”** Thereby giving the reader a good reason to share and spread her message.

## 76\. Where’s my tribe at?

The reason this post stirs the emotional pot is because of **in-group bias**.

Other social media marketers will read this and think, “You tell ‘em, Christina!” Here’s what she does:

- Call out popular criticisms aimed at marketers

- Share her resulting frustrations that marketers will relate with

- Then end strong with a statement that evokes a sense of solidarity among marketers

Her post is divisive. Tribal. It’s an Us (marketers) vs Them (critics) dynamic – a powerful attention-getting play – that, in this case, pits those who “do” against those who “yap.”

Hear, hear, Christina! Say it again.

## 77\. What are the costs of inaction? (FOMO)

What problem is your reader ignoring?

What price are they paying for sweeping it under the rug?

Perhaps it's money, time, resources, attention – whatever it is, by burying their head in the sand, they’re losing out. However, persuading them otherwise won’t be easy.

But one thing you can do is show them the costs of ignoring the problem.

Luke achieves this by tapping into our innate fear of missing out (FOMO). He lays out what’s at stake:

“→ Struggle with cold outbound

→ Throw your money away on ads

→ Watch your leads gen channels die”

He paints a vivid picture of the opportunity costs. In marketing, this is known as ‘twisting the knife.’ He makes the negative consequences real for the reader, which evokes a sense of urgency in the reader to do something about it.

So, if you want to become more persuasive, try what Luke does:

1. Lay out (or imply) a problem

2. Show people the negative impacts of staying the same

3. Highlight the benefits of making a change

## 78\. Storytelling that grips the reader

“The late CEO of Zappos, Tony Hsieh, used to offer new hires $2,000 on the spot to leave the company.”

This short anecdote is Reno’s hook. It’s a highly unusual business tactic. Shocking, even.

It leaves the reader wondering why.

Reno immediately gives a reason why in line 2, giving the reader an immediate payoff for their curiosity. He then begins line 3 with:

“He would also fly candidates to their HQ for final round interviews.”

Given what the reader now knows about Tony’s unconventional approach to hiring, they’re hooked – eager to know what other unusual tactics he has up his sleeve.

Reno takes his time before delivering the next payoff… four sentences.

Stories are gripping when they continue to raise and answer questions. This concept is known as tension and release. Questions arise in the reader’s mind (tension), then get answered (release) – and the cycle repeats.

To write compelling stories, ask yourself this after every line:

Am I building or releasing the tension here?

Building tension evokes curiosity and gets the reader emotionally invested. Releasing tension gives the reader a satisfying payoff, keeping them engaged. Great stories strike a balance between the two.

## 79\. How to win trust by being (too) honest

People are naturally sceptical of unfamiliar businesses.

Especially those who only make exaggerated claims and pretend what they sell is perfect. So, how can you lower people’s defences and get them to trust you?

Well, one way is to be refreshingly candid.

Below, Chava talks about the limitations of her craft (copywriting). Transparency like this is rare. In general, people are terrified of drawing attention to their offer’s shortcomings for fear they’ll lose business.

But radical honesty can be a powerful business strategy for a number of reasons:

- When you give prospects the whole picture, they see you as more credible

- It helps you stand out when competitors all act like what they sell is flawless

- It sets realistic expectations from the start, reducing the risk of dissatisfaction later

Volkswagen released a series of popular VW Beetle ads back in the ‘60s, using this premise – including:

“It’s ugly, but it gets you there.”

So, why sugarcoat it? By mentioning your offer’s limitations, you build your credibility. Counter-intuitive as it may seem.

After all, customers aren’t stupid.

And they’ll likely find out in the long run.

### Here’s the post template:

This may lose me some business, but it has to be said:

## 80\. Want your idea to really resonate? Try this…

Paint a vivid future and place your reader in it.

Alex wastes no time helping his reader imagine a hypothetical scenario – “Imagine waking up 40 years from now…”

Doing so shifts people from their logical left brain into their emotional right brain. In copywriting, this technique is called ‘hypnotic stems.’ Other examples include:

- “Picture this…”

- “Have you ever…”

- “Suppose you could…”

Appealing to the reader’s emotions can make your ideas more persuasive. It lights up more areas of the brain, making your words more memorable. They literally get to live out the scenario you depict in their head.

Painting a vivid future helps the reader recognise the gap between where they are and where they want to be – inspiring in them a desire to change.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/mYpye9CMjMErH0sAC6ud2aOdpAc.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Imagine waking up \[years from now\] and \[briefly sum up negative future state\].

- \[Downside 1\]

- \[Downside 2\]

And to top it off, \[key negative outcome\].

You’d probably find this \[negative emotion\].

It would mean \[explain the core message—why this scenario is undesirable\].

To \[achieve a desirable future state\], \[key concept\] is crucial. But it doesn’t happen by accident.

\[Brief analogy or metaphor that helps reader better grasp key concept\].

How is this made possible?

## 81\. How to explain an abstract idea

A brand is an abstract concept.

"A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service, or organization" – Marty Neumeier

For the unfamiliar, it may be difficult to grasp.

Dakota knows this – so he gives a well-known example of branding in the retail space (a Walmart t-shirt vs. a Gucci t-shirt) to frame his reader’s understanding. This lays the foundation for his argument that personal branding in the entrepreneurial space works the same way.

There are plenty of abstract concepts in business.

So rather than just explaining the concept, look outside your field for examples that exist in more familiar domains. Demonstrate what you mean with a relatable example – like this:

**Abstract concept:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

**Relatable example:** A gym membership vs. a one-off class – a gym goer who pays for a yearly membership (high CLV) is worth more to gyms than someone who pays for a one-time class (low CLV).

Doing this helps the reader grasp the idea, before you relate it to your own circumstance.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/oBiiGjbp8BDGsxJ5Q4SYWVU3AJg.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Compare two products or ideas from a well-known domain that demonstrate an abstract concept\].

\[Briefly explain the abstract concept\].

\[Name the abstract concept\].

The same goes for \[target audience/industry\].

\[Statement that sums up why abstract concept relates to target audience/industry\].

The reason I can \[take related action\] vs. \[other entities that take another related action\]:

\[Name the abstract concept again\].

\[List what other entities lack\].

\[Explain why abstract concept is beneficial to consider/implement for target audience\].

\[Give an example of other well-known individuals or companies that apply the same abstract concept in their businesses\].

## 82\. What can creators learn from ‘David and Goliath’?

Julius’ hook:

“In 2022, these co-founders risked ALL their savings to take on industry giants like Weetabix, Cheerios and Kellogg’s.”

Immediately, he shares:

- The David of the story: the co-founders

- What’s at stake: “ALL their savings”

- And the story’s Goliath: Weetabix, Cheerios and Kellogg’s.

On hearing these facts, the reader becomes emotionally invested. People love rooting for an underdog. When they prevail…

It gives us hope. It floods our brains with feel-good chemicals. And [studies show](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871187117300676) it stimulates creativity.

Here are 5 ways you can leverage the ‘David and Goliath’ story in your own content:

1. **You’re David** \- share the risks you took, the struggles you faced, and the odds you overcame.

2. **Your team is David** \- share how your small or under-resourced team took on a big challenge and succeeded.

3. **Your product is David** \- share how your product or service achieved the seemingly impossible.

4. **Your customer is David** \- break down how one (or more) of your clients triumphed despite the obstacles they faced, in a way that prospects will relate to.

5. **Your industry peer is David** \- celebrate how a fellow professional or company defied expectations – like Julius does below.

## 83\. Let’s talk brackets (aka. parentheses)

These little curvy badboys are incredibly versatile. Use them to:

- **Add extra info without breaking sentence flow**

e.g. I offer two training formats: in-person (available in UK-only) or virtual (for global teams)

- **Provide alternative phrases or options**

e.g. DM me if interested (or ping me an email: joe@company.com)

- **Clarify terms and phrases**

e.g. "The new compliance regs (GDPR) were tough to navigate”

- **Credit your sources**

e.g. “SaaS companies that regularly blog generate 67% more leads than those that don’t (Hubspot report, 2023)”

Or, like Wes, you can use them to add a personal or humorous comment – “...and (my personal favorite)”

## 84\. Want to craft posts that sell? Try this…

Show you understand what your prospective customers may have tried in the past.

Chances are, if someone has a burning problem (i.e. one you help solve), they may have already tried to solve it. Perhaps they:

- Went for a DIY approach

- Used a similar product or service to yours

- Or, all of the above

By acknowledging your prospect’s past efforts and unmet needs, you build trust. You position yourself as an empathetic problem-solver. Someone who gets what they’re going through.

This is especially important when prospects have tried and failed to solve their problems with your competitors. Understandably, they’ll be sceptical. So soften their defenses by calling it out – like Shoaib does (“The client had a ghostwriter previously”).

He also gives plenty of proof (desirable results) and reasons (benefits) as to why you should consider working with him.

“Write the way you talk. Naturally.” – David Ogilvy

Sara does a great job of this.

When you see her picture then read her post, it’s like you’re hearing it in her voice. What she's written isn’t stilted and businesslike. It’s conversational.

- She uses short, choppy sentences

- She starts sentences with ‘So’ and ‘But’

- She uses playful language like ‘stalked’, ‘Fair play’, and ‘popping up’

It comes across as warm, friendly, and relatable.

## 86\. How To Get People To (Actually) See Your Long-Form Content

Here’s the truth:

People scrolling on LinkedIn don’t care about your long-form content housed elsewhere.

They’re more than happy to keep scrolling. Why? Because social media platforms pay hordes of super-smart data scientists lots of money to design algorithms that keep people glued to their platforms for as long as possible.

This helps them sell more ad space to advertisers, netting them billions in yearly ad revenue.

In other words, it’s not easy getting people to click off of LinkedIn.

Many people will post on LinkedIn about new blogs, newsletters, webinars, videos, etc. – only to find barely anyone clicking through. Here are 3 common reasons why:

They fail to resonate with their target audience’s pain points.

They fail to show people why they’re worth listening to.

They fail to give value in the post itself.

## 87\. Why You Should ‘Show Your Work’ (Sell More With This Trick)

Alex’s hook:

“I’ve invested over $124k this year and 1100+ hours on this idea.”

Can you spot the underlying psychology here?

People perceive products and content as more valuable when they believe more effort (or “work”) has gone into its creation. This is known as the labour illusion effect.

So give the reader a peak behind the scenes.

- Share how much time or money you’ve invested into an idea – like Alex does.

- Highlight specific efforts made by you or your team to develop or deliver a product.

This kind of transparency shows people you're committed. It shows you care about the product and the outcome you help them achieve.

## 88\. Ever feel like you have nothing of value to share?

“Lots of us have expertise in particular areas. Becoming an expert in something means that we become more and more fascinated by nuance and complexity. That’s when the curse of knowledge kicks in, and we start to forget what it’s like not to know what we know.”

– Chip & Dan Heath, authors of ‘Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die’

The curse of knowledge refers to when we assume others have the same level of understanding as us on a given topic. It’s what stops many people from creating content.

“For years, I got away with murder, then one morning my world got rocked…”

“She had everything going for her: a dream job, a caring husband, a healthy baby girl – then BAM…”

What is the key moment of change (or turning point) in your story?

Perhaps it was when:

- You had a major breakthrough

- You took a risk and it paid off

- You faced a major adversity

- Someone believed in you

- Someone doubted you

- You hit rock bottom

Identify that pivotal moment before you start writing. Use it to demonstrate a transformation you (or someone else) underwent – like Dan does.

### Here’s the post template:

This is me at \[age/time period ago – note: this should coincide with the photo you include with the post\] going through \[challenging situation\].

The \[challenges\] I faced were no joke:

\[Briefly describe specific issues going on at the time\].

And that’s not all.

\[Briefly describe 1 or 2 more specific issues going on at the time\].

My \[life/business/career\] was spiralling out of control.

\[List some of the negative repercussions\].

\[Reflect on how you were and what you thought at the time\].

But you know what?

Sometimes you just need \[briefly describe the moment that changed everything\].

\[Give some more details that relate to what happened – e.g. include events, quotes, realisations\].

I decided \[describe what you did next – e.g. how your mindset or trajectory changed\].

And the rest is history.

Looking back, \[reflect on the key thing you learned\].

It’s easy to \[let the above challenges affect you in a negative way\].

But what I failed to realise was \[key realisation that seeded a more positive mindset\].

\[Key takeaway(s)\].

\[Call to action or question for audience\].

## 90\. How to make obvious insights compelling

On the surface, “Choose your leaders well” seems obvious. But when paired with the downfall of one of the most well-known brands on the planet (Nike), people flock to hear all the gory details.

And Andy doesn’t disappoint.

He shares well-researched facts, shocking stats, a sobering quote from a Nike insider, and an ironic twist that sees the ousted CEO walk away from it all “with millions in his pocket.”

So, while Andy’s core lesson may seem like common sense – it’s how he brings this lesson to life through research, story, and examples that make it so impactful…

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PlPPm69TeIlQdz13AgFXtNMU.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Bold statement that sums up core lesson from historic event\].

After \[time period\], \[describe key recent event\]. \[Briefly describe how things were before this event in a way that illustrates the transformation\].

But due to \[key detail relating to this recent event\], \[share supporting facts or stats that demonstrate the overall outcome\].

What happened?

\[List reasons for what happened – include specific names, facts, and examples where possible\].

The result was \[Include another key fact, stat, or expert quote\].

\[Give your take on what happened – consider using a comparison or analogy to illustrate your point\].

\[Briefly describe a key event that’s happened since the main event described above\].

The lesson?

\[Key takeaway\].

## 91\. Why People Ignore Your Content

The most common objection readers have is: “Why should I listen to you?”

As a creator, you’re competing for attention. If you fail to prove why you’re qualified to speak on a topic, your content will go unnoticed.

Adrian tackles this objection by pairing his advice to start a personal brand with the impressive results this strategy has yielded for his agency.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/VfBgswHqCn5ivOZD6PeEZMHxQ0.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Don’t \[insert common practice\].

Start \[alternative action(s)\].

\[Briefly list reasons why alternative action(s) are beneficial to the reader\].

\[Summarise the name and key desirable outcome of the strategy outlined above\].

\[Share results you or your customers have achieved using this strategy\].

Without \[strategy\], none of this would have been possible.

## 92\. Boost The Persuasiveness Of Any Idea

“Stories are remembered up to 22x more than facts alone.” – Stanford Professor Jennifer Aaker

When selling people on ideas, you’re giving them a new way to look at the world. To do this, there is no way more powerful than bringing an idea to life using a story.

Olena conveys the idea that messaging and words matter with an anecdote of a young boy begrudgingly going to meet an unfamiliar celebrity.

The funny twist illustrates why messaging and words matter more than any number of facts and stats ever could on their own.

## 93\. How To Write An Event Invite Post

Based on Chris’ post, here’s a checklist of elements to include for the next time you’re promoting an event:

- **Call out a common pain point** in your hook.

- **List desirable outcomes ideal attendees are after**. Help them imagine what it’s like to have solved said problem – e.g. “What if you could… \[unlock these outcomes\]”

- **Handle a key common objection** – e.g. “All of this without…\[obstacle\].” Doing this helps allay any doubts people may have, preventing them from attending your event.

- **Explain why you (or whoever’s hosting/speaking) are worth listening to**. Focus on specific achievements, results or accreditations that make you (or others) an authority on the topic(s) being covered.

- **Explain why what you’re sharing is \*unique\*** – e.g. give the information you're sharing a unique name like Chris does (“...I’m sharing my signature SALES framework”). This implies attendees won’t readily find this info elsewhere, piquing curiosity. Keep this clear and relevant. Don’t overthink it.

- **Mention WHO it’s for, specifically** – e.g. Chris doesn’t just say the event is for “creative service professionals” (a little vague), he gets specific “...(designers, strategists, marketers, coaches).” This implies the event is not only tailored to these individuals, but also serves as a great opportunity to meet industry peers and prospective customers.

- **Expand on the topic of focus**. Now you’ve got the attention of the right people, you can further explain what’s being covered and/or handle any other objections prospects may have. Thereby dissolving any remaining doubts and reassuring people that your event is a no-brainer.

- **List the key event details** – ie. date, location, price, co-presenters, etc.

- **Provide a clear call to action**. Direct people to the next step they must take (e.g. provide a link). And explain why they should act now by reiterating the key benefit they stand to gain and by including a ‘limited time only’ discount if possible.

- **Include an eye-catching image to advertise event**. Focus on key event details here (see Chris’ post below).

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aqR6Sy7wRs2NZZq4cMkHzKUV0c.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Want to \[achieve a desired goal\]?

What if you could \[describe relevant scenario\]:

- \[Unlock benefit 1\]

- \[Unlock benefit 2\]

- \[Unlock benefit 3\]

All of this – without \[undesirable action or obstacle\].

\[Briefly explain why you or others involved are qualified to speak on the topic – e.g. include achievements, results, or accreditations\].

This \[event\] is designed specifically for \[target audience\] and focuses on \[unique selling point\], helping you master \[key skill or area of expertise\].

\[Give any further details – e.g. reinforce a key benefit or allay objections\].

Join us on \[event date\].

At \[Location\].

\[$Price\].

\[Call to action that makes sense for your event – you may want to include additional details, discounts, or bonuses for people who purchase tickets now\].

## 94\. The Inverted Pyramid Technique

Journalists will often tell stories using ‘The Inverted Pyramid’ structure where the most crucial, attention-grabbing info leads.

It involves getting straight to the point. You immediately tell the reader what the story is about, before setting the context and filling in the gaps. It’s perfect for writing online, where most people will only ever read the hook to see if they’re interested in reading more.

Timothy opens with an extraordinary fact about a man who donates £2.1M+ a day. By doing so he does the reader a favour. He effectively summarises all the information to follow, while also leaving lots of unanswered questions, such as:

- Who is this man?

- What does he do?

- Who is he donating to?

- Where does the money come from?

Tips for writing in the Inverted Pyramid style:

1. Outline your story.

2. Identify the main point – i.e. the key takeaway that sums up everything.

3. Use this main point as your hook.

4. Push any other interesting details with broad appeal to the top.

5. Then tell the rest of the story in a way that answers any unanswered questions.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TVPPaRgnQEJGfefamxr69iihw.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Person or Entity\] \[achieves remarkable feat\] and is regarded as “\[relevant moniker\]”.

\[Notable fact or stat that has broad appeal\].

This is the \[adjective\] story of \[Person or Entity’s Name\].

\[Describe their humble beginnings and/or prior struggles they faced\].

\[Mention the turning point – i.e. a key event, achievement or realisation\].

\[Include the relevant events that happened next to advance the story – e.g. did they meet any pivotal characters or do anything of note?\]

Except \[their venture or approach\] was different.

\[Break down the facts and figures behind the remarkable feat described in the hook, giving brief explanations where necessary\].

\[Conclude with a statement that describes the wider impacts of feat\].

\[Positive or inspiring takeaway\].

\[Question to foster engagement from audience\]?

## 95\. Gamify Your Educational Content

Daliana’s visually engaging approach turns passive content consumers into active participants.

Her image serves as an entertaining thought experiment set in a familiar context (i.e. which image got the most Netflix plays – A or B?). The reader’s eagerness for an answer draws them into a post that educates them on the underlying technical concept of “contextual bandits for AI.”

The takeaway?

Use challenges, thought experiments, or guessing games to make your educational content more interactive and fun.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/NAZtdjjtWm9sYyQqypfU0vA9OE.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Follow on from image with a relevant statement or question that piques curiosity – e.g. “You probably won’t guess it.”\].

\[Introduce and explain key concept from image\].

For example, \[explain how the key concept informs what’s going on in the image or the choice the reader makes\]. (Source: \[Credit source(s) if applicable\].

\[Describe the key benefit(s) of applying key concept\].

\[Suggest how key concept can be used in other contexts – if this applies to your context\].

\[Revelant call to action – eg. an event invite or link to an additional content resource\].

\[Image of thought experiment, challenge or guessing game that relates to key concept from post\].

## 96\. How To Craft A Prediction Post

Prediction posts tend to generate high engagement because they invite discussion and debate. They’re polarising.

They can also boost your authority.

Sharing your opinion on where you think your industry or field is going shows you have your finger on the pulse. It implies you have vision.

Here are 4 elements Tommy uses to increase the credibility (and value) of his prediction post:

- Recent trends involving well-known companies

- A balanced view of opportunities and risks

- Observations from an industry insider

- Practical advice for those affected

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/hateJ9Fv1dNWqwH6WLn5H8LkrM.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I’m interested to see if \[industry prediction\].

Here's what I’m noticing:

## 97\. Struggling With Something? Ask Your Audience

Most LinkedIn content solves problems for the audience.

But what if it’s you, the creator, who needs help?

Below, Erin lays out her recent struggles with writing. Then at the end of her post, she lists 4 practical steps she’s taking to remedy the problem – before asking her audience for advice.

In effect, she’s crowdsourcing fresh ideas. And why not?

## 98\. “What’s the benefit of the benefit?” – Dan Nelken

Matt helps people generate leads on LinkedIn.

The goal of Matt’s post is to compel people to book a meeting with him. However, driving leads with content is not easy. First, the reader must believe that Matt can deliver on his promises.

So Matt empathises with his target audience, showing them he encounters similar challenges. But rather than do what many people do—i.e. “Stick their head in the sand” and “\[pray\] that the leads will pick up next week”—he relies on his skills to take control of his situation.

Skills that can also help the reader to:

- Generate leads…

- SO THAT they can book meetings…

- SO THAT they’ll never be stressed about revenue again…

- SO THAT they can take control of their business and build the life they (and their family) deserve

The lesson? Don’t just stop at the first benefit.

Ask yourself: What’s the benefit of the benefit? For instance, in this case, why is generating leads important? What deeper benefits does generating leads unlock?

Show people you really understand their wants, needs, and desires.

## 99\. Creative Reframing (Not Enough Creators Do This)

See Tim’s image hook:

“My first business took 4 long years to finally become profitable.

That’s 1,500 days with no reward.”

By reframing years into days, Tim adds extra emphasis to his key idea that, “Persistence is a profitable skill.” It magnifies the emotional weight of his experience. His words become more impactful.

And this technique of ‘creative reframing’ doesn’t just have to apply to timeframes – eg.

- “I hit 100,000 followers last week.

That’s enough people to fill Barcelona FC's Camp Nou.”

- “We didn’t just make $1M in revenue…

We made enough to buy 50,000 pizzas and still tip well.”

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TAjNmliiogSlXr9SL6wd07rQI.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[A past struggle you faced\].

That’s \[statement that emphasises implications of struggle\].

## 100\. Grab Attention With The Unexpected

Henneke opens with an unusual admission that is sure to pique some interest. It’s a story half-told. It comes across as shocking in an otherwise civilised and business-oriented LinkedIn feed.

So next time you’re brainstorming hooks, consider how you can lead with the unexpected – e.g.

- **A shocking event:** “I lost $100k on one decision–and it was the best decision I’ve ever made.”

- **A vulnerable admission:** “I gave the worst speech ever in front of 500 people.”

- **A provocative belief:** “I don’t believe in work-life balance.”

## 101\. Beautify Your Lists\

\
Below, Justyna includes two lists. Lists are great because they neatly organise information, so it’s easy to read and digest.\
\
But imagine if Justyna’s lists looked like this:\
\

1. First list item goes here, and continues for a bit\
   \
2. Then there’s another\
   \
3. And another, but you know what? We’ll keep this one rollin’\
   \
4. This one’s short\
   \
5. This one is kinda mid-range\
   \
6. This\
   \
7. And another long point for you. Here we go, and I think you get the picture…\
   \
   \
   If you clicked “see more” and saw this monstrosity, you’d likely keep scrolling. No matter how enticing the hook was.\
   \
   Remember: the reader sees your post before they read it.\
   \
   Scruffy and unformatted text will likely equate to lower readership. Neat, well-formatted content is, in part, why top creators get lots of readers and engagement.\
   \
   “Try to format the list items by length → TRY” – Jasmin Alić\

## 102\. Is It All Just BS? (99% Of Creators Won’t Do This)\

\
Try this:\
\

1. Make a list of all the widely accepted ideas, beliefs, and practices in your space.\
   \
2. Then consider the flaws, limitations, and validity of each idea.\
   \
   \
   Put them under a microscope. Poke holes in them.\
   \
   You may just find many so-called truths are built on rickety foundations. Because here’s the thing…\
   \
   Most people don’t question what they hear. If information is repeated often enough, people just blindly accept it (as per the illusory truth effect).\
   \
   Why?\
   \
   Because thinking critically is hard. Challenging the norms online is scary. And reviewing the counter-evidence takes time and effort.\
   \
   But, if you’re willing to do your homework, thoughtfully zigging while others zag (like Ryan does) can help you:\

- Stand out\

## 103\. How To Keep People Reading (A Storytelling Trick)\

\
Love stories? Great, then you’ll love this.\
\
A good LinkedIn story keeps people on the edge of their office chairs. To help you pen suspenseful, curiosity-driven stories, here’s a storytelling device for you:\
\
**Foreshadowing** – i.e. to hint at, warn, or allude to a future event.\
\
Daniel peppers in a handful of these phrases below, including:\
\

- “4 years ago, I \*accidentally\* changed the trajectory of my life forever.”\
  \
- "Around the same time, a guy called Dickie Bush had also just started writing there."\
  \
- "So I armed myself with courage and I sent Dickie a cold DM offering my help."\
  \
- “But after finishing that second cohort, I realized Ship 30 was about to blow up.”\
  \
  \
  Each phrase keeps the reader on the hook, eager to find out more.\
  \
  People are naturally curious. Especially about each other.\
  \
  So when you tell stories, as soon as you reveal something – follow that sentence with one that foreshadows what’s yet to unfold. Keep the reader on the hook.\

## 104\. How To Write An Offer Post\

\
For someone to take you up on an offer, they must first see it as valuable.\
\
But value is in the eye of the beholder. It’s imaginary.\
\
“There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so” – W. Shakespeare\
\
On LinkedIn, the term “value” is a buzzword. But in reality, it’s shorthand for the term: \*perceived\* value. Because unless you perceive something as valuable, then it’s as good as dirt on your shoe.\
\
So, how do you boost the perceived value of an offer?\
\
Here are 7 common objections people have when it comes to business offers, and how Isabella deals with them:\
\

1. **Is it worth the monetary price?** It’s free.\
   \
2. **Is it simple to obtain and use?** Yep. Like, repost, and follow to gain access. All the information is housed in a Google doc.\
   \
3. **Is it backed by a trusted source?** Here are the results this exact process has driven for my businesses… (see post).\
   \
4. **Does the reward outweigh the risk?** Again, it’s free, quick to obtain, and proven to be effective.\
   \
5. **Does it fulfil my specific wants, needs, and desires?** Here are lists of the solutions, benefits, and bonuses… (see post).\
   \
6. **Why should I act now?** I was going to charge $500 for this (price anchoring), but it’s now free on LinkedIn for the next 48 hours (urgency play).\
   \
7. **Can it help me achieve the outcome I’m after in a reasonable time period?** This process helped me take my new business from $0 → $85k in less than 60 days.\
   \
   \
   Take note of these 7 questions, and address them next you write an offer post.\

## 105\. The Old Way vs. The New Way\

\
Dan uses a proven marketing angle. He contrasts the old (broken) way of doing things with the new (better) way of doing things.\
\
Here are some reasons why this approach is so powerful:\
\

- It offers fresh hope to people who are fed up/unsuccessful with the old way\
  \
- It taps into FOMO as people don’t wanna be left behind\
  \
- And people love new stuff\
  \
  \
  So next time you're brainstorming new content ideas, consider the ‘old way vs new way’ angle – eg.\
  \
- Design an ‘old way vs new way’ image\
  \
- Contrast how you used to do something with how you do it now\
  \
- List the unwritten rules in your industry vs. what to expect in 2025\
  \
- Post a case study comparing your client’s old approach with your approach\
  \
  \
  Get creative.\

## 106\. Speaking The LinkedIn Lingo\

\
We’re all social chameleons.\
\
Think about it…\
\
How you speak with your elderly neighbour will differ from how you speak with a good friend after a couple of drinks. How you speak with a prospective customer will differ from how you speak with your 5-year-old niece.\
\
People tailor what they say to the environment, the audience. And communicating online is no different. For example:\
\

- Twitter favours brevity, direct language, abbreviations\
  \
- TikTok favours more playful, often meme-inspired language\
  \
- Instagram is more visual, with short caption-based language\
  \
  \
  Then there’s LinkedIn, which strikes a more professional, authoritative tone.\
  \
  Each platform has a unique purpose, culture, and shared language (as Amelia alludes to below). So, bear this in mind when deciding what to post.\

### Here’s the post template:\

\

## 107\. Your LinkedIn Content Is The Front Door\

\
You can only go so deep on LinkedIn. It is social media after all. People scroll. They skim. You only ever have their attention for a short time.\
\
So, think of LinkedIn content as a means to attract people into your universe.\
\
Over time, a subset of your audience will want to go deeper. This is where long-form content like courses, eBooks, newsletters, podcasts, blogs, and YouTube videos – can help.\
\
It holds attention for longer.\
\
It builds deeper trust with your audience.\
\
It gives you a vehicle to promote your higher-ticket products and services.\
\
Another big advantage of long-form content (like Matt’s free book offer) is that people will gladly exchange their email for it. This gives you a direct line to your audience via a channel you own. Rather than solely relying on the LinkedIn algorithm, which changes like the wind, and only ever shows your content to a select few people from your audience.\

## 108\. “Why Good Design Is Important”\

\
Almost all LinkedIn posts have a visual component these days.\
\
So it’s important to understand visual hierarchy, a design concept that helps make your visuals easy to digest and understand.\
\
“Visual hierarchy controls the delivery of the experience. If you have a hard time figuring out where to look on a page, it’s more than likely that its layout is missing a clear visual hierarchy.”\
\
– The Nielsen Norman Group\
\
Here are the 8 key visual design principles:\
\

1. **Size** \- larger elements draw more attention than smaller elements.\
   \
2. **Colour** \- Bright colours typically attract more attention than muted ones.\
   \
3. **Contrast** \- contrasting colours (and elements) can be used to direct attention.\
   \
4. **Alignment** \- gives structure and order, helping guide the reader.\
   \
5. **Repetition** \- repeating elements and styles suggest content is related.\
   \
6. **Proximity** \- groups of elements seem related.\
   \
7. **White space** \- more space around elements draws the eye to them.\
   \
8. **Texture and style** \- give depth and dimension to visuals.\
   \
   \
   Here, Jackson demonstrates a strong visual hierarchy:\

## 109\. The Progressive Timeline Technique\

\
Roxana uses the progressive timeline technique to support her key point (that publishing content leads to opportunities).\
\
This approach serves as a snappy way to showcase specific changes or improvements over time.\
\
You could also use a progressive timeline to highlight:\
\

- Your business journey\
  \
- Your client’s progression\
  \
- Key events in your industry\
  \
- Your company (or creator) milestones\
  \
- How peoples’ perceptions have changed\
  \
  \
  Apply it to a context that makes sense for you.\

## 110\. The No.1 Way To Boost Your Authority, Land More Clients & Start Charging More\

\
Client testimonials.\
\
(Testimonial - a fancy marketing word for a positive customer review).\
\
The most persuasive element in Shoaib’s case study post is the video testimonial.\
\
Testimonials are a massively powerful form of social proof. They show prospective customers that you’re legit, you know what you’re doing, and that you get results.\
\
All creators, businesses, coaches, freelancers, etc., make well-worded claims in efforts to sell their products and services – eg. “I can help you do X, Y, Z.” However, unless you can prove what you say is true, you’ll likely struggle.\
\
So, collect client/customer testimonials as if your life depends on it (because it kinda does).\
\
Here are some quick tips:\
\

- Follow up 30 days or so after you’ve delivered a project. This way, you give your client time to see results. Ask for stats like conversion rate, email open rates, lead flow, revenue generated, or whatever makes sense for your business. Showcasing results dramatically increases your credibility.\
  \
- Time it right. Ask for a testimonial when your client signals satisfaction. For instance, if you’ve just finished a project and they send you a message like, “Wow, this is great!” That’s a great time to ask.\
  \
- If you receive positive client feedback in an email, DM, or Slack channel – ask them whether you can screenshot and share it.\
  \
- Use tools like [testimonial.to](http://testimonial.to/) or [boast](https://boast.io/) to collect testimonials with ease. And/or keep a testimonials file on your computer.\
  \
- Ask for LinkedIn recommendations (it takes seconds to do - not enough people do this).\

## 111\. How To Make Common Insights Yours!\

\
“Today, there’s no shortage of information.”\
\
Yawn! Let's slather some butter on this insight…\
\
In 2024, it’s projected that humans will generate 147 zettabytes of data. That’s enough bytes to replace every grain of sand on Earth 5X over (with a couple of Sahara deserts to spare).\
\
The lesson? Just sharing insights is not enough. Especially in an AI era. Add some sauce to those insights. Jazz ‘em up a bit. Make them interesting. Make them yours.\
\
Here’s a great way to do this:\
\
Pair your insights with unique examples – like the sand example above and how Nigel does below. Doing so helps the reader better grasp and remember any practical advice you share.\

## 112\. Be The Guinea Pig (Your Audience Will Love You For It)\

\
Digital tools are great, sure. They can speed up and even replace tasks. But who has the time to experiment with all the new tools flooding the market?\
\
No one would blame you for sticking with what you know. In fact, that’s what most people do. But is this the best approach long term?\
\
No.\
\
Sticking to your guns pretty much ensures you’ll miss out at some stage – and people hate to miss out (FOMO).\
\
So think about what tools make your workflows easier. If they help you, they’ll likely help someone else.\
\
Then take a leaf out of Anna’s book, and share how that tool has helped you solve a relatable challenge. If you can turn your audience on to a tool that saves them time, effort, or money – they’ll feel like they owe you one (law of reciprocity).\

### Here’s the post template:\

\
"If \[generating specific output\] were as simple as \[simplified approach\], we’d all be \[experiencing desirable outcome\].\
\
But nowadays, \[describe current expectations or requirements in the field\].\
\
It’s about \[key elements of a successful approach\].\
\
And to be honest?\
\
That kind of \[skill/knowledge/approach\] \[requires specific sacrifice\].\
\
Recently, I found myself \[struggling with task or challenge\].\
\
\[Negative consequence(s) of struggle\].\
\
That’s when I tried \[tool/resource/strategy\]—and it was game-changing.\

  \
- \[Feature or benefit 3\]: \[Briefly describe how it makes things easier/quicker/cheaper\]\

  \
  And here’s the best part…\
  \
  I \[sum up how tool/resource/strategy helped you achieve desirable outcome\].\

  \
- With his new, streamlined follow-up process\
  \
- Before outlining a couple of key benefits\
  \
- And providing a call to action w/ a link\

  \
  Simple.\

## 114\. There’s More Than One Way To Win\

\
Ever heard of Federer, Djokovic, or Nadal?\
\
They’re the 3 most dominant male tennis stars of all time. But here’s what’s interesting…\
\
They all approached the game completely differently.\
\

- Federer played with a cool, graceful elegance.\
  \
  **Known for:** a fluid one-handed backhand and exceptional net play.\
  \
- Djokovic’s plays with near-inhuman efficiency and agility.\
  \
  **Known for:** a powerful two-handed backhand and outstanding return of serve.\
  \
- Nadal played with ruthless aggression and power.\
  \
  **Known for:** a heavy topspin forehand and unparalleled footwork.\
  \
  \
  3 different approaches. Yet the outcome they all strived for was the same.\
  \
  There’s often more than one way to win (at any game you play, including LinkedIn) – as Erica points out:\

\
Whether you’re:\
\

- Introducing team members\
  \
- Showcasing your day-in-the-life\
  \
- Sharing stories from your creator journey\
  \
  \
  Or, celebrating a business milestone – like Kuba. Behind-the-scenes (BTS) content is a great way to invite your audience into your world.\
  \
  After all, businesses are just groups of people. And people tend to trust people more than faceless businesses. Hence why personal branding has exploded recently.\
  \
  So, give people a peek behind the scenes. Dare to connect with your audience.\

## 116\. The Key To Making An Idea Uniquely Yours\

\
Many creators simply parrot what other creators have already said.\
\
This is the road to ruin. It damages your credibility. You blend into a sea of copycat creators.\
\
That said, you don’t need to be completely original. After all, there are only so many proven ideas to write about. And if an idea works and draws attention, then why not post about it?\
\
But here’s the thing…\
\
How you present that idea to the world matters.\
\
Let’s take what Andrea does below. Rather than list what makes an ad great (which anyone can do), she breaks down a clever example. She applies these ideas to a real-world context.\
\
She also identifies an area for improvement, which showcases the value she can bring to a business looking to optimise its LinkedIn ads.\
\
The lesson? Breathe uniqueness into ideas by pairing them with stories, analogies, examples, and your authentic voice.\

## 117\. How To Write A (Valuable) Case Study\

\
Case study posts sell.\
\
They show prospective customers what you can do. They foster trust. They build your authority – so when you speak with these prospects, they’re already half-sold on working with you.\
\
So how do you write one?\
\
Here’s a dead-simple checklist you can use for your next case study post:\
\

- **A compelling hook** \- the goal here is to grab the attention of the right people. Forget about going viral. Case studies should address a specific target audience. For example, Dakota introduces his client and shares an impressive result he helped them achieve.\
  \
- **Client context**\- introduce the client, where they started, the challenges they faced. This helps prospects in a similar position to relate.\
  \
- **Break down your strategies or solutions** \- show people your way of doing things. Help them to imagine what it’s like to work with you.\
  \
- **Share practical insights they can apply today**\- Dakota doesn’t just sit on his secrets, he shares them. He knows people pay for implementation and accountability, not information.\
  \
- **Desirable outcomes** \- Dakota peppers these throughout his post. They can range from quantifiable results (e.g. “Then he started making $40k/month”) to concrete benefits (e.g. “This will help you grow AND prove yourself”).\
  \
- **A clear call to action (CTA)**\- What’s the next step you want prospects to take? Do you want them to click a link? Reach out? Follow you? Pick the ONE that makes the most sense.\
  \
- **Visuals**\- Images grab attention. Dakota humanises his post by including a photo of his client. But you could also incorporate client results and/or testimonials.\
  \
  \
  ![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/B2Jt4rvU7EIwvMy0ZW8aMhXKq4.png)\
  \

### Here’s the post template:\

\
This is my \[relation/friend/client\], \[Person’s Name\].\
\
I helped them \[achieve specific, impressive result\].\
\
If you want to \[achieve goal\], read this:\
\
I met \[Name\] in \[timeframe\].\
\
At the time, they were \[describe the initial situation\].\
\
Fast forward to today, they’re \[describe the transformation\].\
\
The problem with most \[profession/role/group\] is \[specific issue\].\
\
So, we focused on fixing \[specific areas or challenges\].\
\
We implemented \[framework/strategy/method\] to help them \[unlock benefit\].\
\
Here’s how it works:\
\
\[List and briefly explain each step involved – consider including issues overcome, questions to aid reader reflection, any unique frameworks you used, and any desirable outcomes or impressive results they achieved along the way\].\
\
With these changes, \[Name\] went from \[before state\] to \[after state\].\
\
Now, they \[describe current success\].\
\
If you want to \[pursue goal/unlock key desirable outcome\], \[relevant call to action\].\

\
Josh’s hook:\
\
“My dad passed away at the age of 52.”\
\

- It implies there’s more to the story\
  \
- It implies the post has broad appeal\
  \
- It implies lessons or insights may follow\
  \
  \
  Sometimes it’s the words you don’t say that matter most.\
  \
  So when crafting hooks, ask yourself (or ChatGPT): What does this hook imply?\

## 119\. How To Make More $$$ With Content\

\
As Ryan explains, if you want to monetise your social media presence, you must deliver “actual value.”\
\
But what does delivering value actually mean? Let’s define it:\
\
**Valuable content** is well-structured information that helps people overcome a specific problem and attain a desirable outcome.\
\
Now, while shorter, “snack content” (see Ryan’s examples) can still be valuable – it’s usually not enough by itself to turn readers into buyers.\
\
As Ryan says, if you can hold the reader’s attention for longer and provide lots of value, then you can grow a more valuable following and make more money.\
\
How? With longer-form posts – e.g.\
\

- Lists of important considerations (see post template 5)\
  \
- Strategic breakdowns (e.g. ‘How to’s’ and ‘How I’s’)\
  \
- Client case studies (see post template 2), and\
  \
- Insight-laden analysis posts\
  \
  \
  It’s these kinda posts that help your target audience get from point A to point B. Thereby positioning you as a trusted expert that people will likely buy from.\
  \
  So, regularly assess your content mix to ensure it aligns with your business goals.\
  \
  If your goal is to build trust, start meaningful conversations, and sell more – then focus on delivering more “actual value,” as Ryan says.\

## 120\. How To Argue Your Case (Steal These 11 Post Elements)\

\
Here, Tas gives a masterclass on how to present a persuasive argument.\
\
Her argument?\
\
“For B2B websites, content may be king but... Design is queen.”\
\
Here are 11 elements she includes (that you can use in your posts):\
\
01. Her hook **challenges conventional wisdom** and presents a playful twist on a familiar phrase.\
\
02. She then makes an abstract concept easier to grasp with a **relatable analogy**, before drawing comparisons with B2B website design.\
\
03. She injects her post with **humour and personality** with comments like, “(My millennials, where you at?!)” and “It needs to be like Goldilocks – just right.”\
\
04. She **shares what’s at stake** – “And by the way, your ACV is $50,000+.”\
\
05. She includes multiple **skimmable bullet lists** with tons of **actionable advice**.\
\
06. She **weaves in personal experiences** that enhance her credibility: “Trust me, I was fined for it once.”\
\
07. She **reframes how to think about the topic**: “Your goal is to enable users to consume information about your product or service easily.”\
\
08. She lists **common pitfalls to avoid**.\
\
09. She **backs her argument with data**: "And in B2B - where it takes 31 website touchpoints before a buyer even decides to engage..."\
\
10. She **emphasises key points with repetition and rhythm** – "Every ping, Every pop-up, Every wild movement, Every irrelevant visual” – creating a memorable cadence.\
\
11. And she ends with a **real-world example** to illustrate what \*good\* looks like.\
\
\
Great stuff!\

## 122\. Why Feeling Like An Imposter Is A Good Thing\

\
Everyone (who has an ounce of self-awareness) feels like an imposter.\
\
It’s ok.\
\
It means you’re pushing yourself.\
\
It means you’re growing.\
\
It means you’re human.\
\
Today, Charles has over 130k followers. But when he started creating content, he was afraid. That was until he pushed through the discomfort and had these realisations…\
\

\

### Here’s the post template:\

\
I was afraid to \[relevant action\].\

## 123\. What PROMISE Are You Making The Reader?\

\
LinkedIn is a competitive sport.\
\
Attention is the new oil – as they say. That’s why it’s crucial to make it clear what the reader will get in exchange for reading your post.\
\
Below, Mina’s hook makes a simple promise:\
\
“Underrated B2B content advice:”\
\
Immediately the reader knows:\
\

- WHO it’s for\
  \
- WHAT the post is about\
  \
- WHY they should care\
  \
  \
  This 4-word hook conveys a lot of information.\
  \
  So whether you explicitly state your post’s promise (like Mina does) or leave it implied (like Erin does above) – ensure your promise is clear within the first 1-4 sentences.\
  \
  If in doubt, run the ‘WHO - WHAT - WHY’ framework from above.\
  \
  ![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JMHWJeaN1alttteHBMQwvdzHJHE.png)\
  \

### Here’s the post template:\

\
Underrated \[industry/field\] advice:\
\
\[Core insight framed as a call to reflection or action\].\
\
Let your \[work/content/product\]:\

## 124\. “I Don’t Have Any Stories To Share”\

\
LinkedIn loves stories.\
\
Stories are great vehicles to illustrate lessons and concepts.\
\
However, the stories you share don’t need to involve you. So if you’re sat there, head in hands, thinking:\
\
“Ugh, I don’t have any stories to share.”\
\
Or, “I’d rather not share personal stories”\
\
… then don’t fret – because stories are everywhere. All you have to do is tell them. For instance, you could tell:\
\

- Stories from books (like Shaan does)\
  \
- Hypothetical ‘what-if’ scenarios\
  \
- Industry success stories\
  \
- Quotes with backstories\
  \
- Client success stories\
  \
- News stories\
  \
- Parables\
  \
  \
  And here's the best part… All these story types help you inject memorability into your content while keeping your private life private.\

### Here’s the post template:\

\
A few months ago, I met \[unique or intriguing person\].\
\
\[Briefly tease what makes them and the interaction you had interesting\].\

Here’s what they said:\
\
I asked them \[question\], and they said “\[interesting response that sums up or relates to key lesson\].”\
\
\[Briefly give your take on their response\].\
\
\[Expand on the lesson further: set up the situation/problem, add relevant context, reveal resulting actions\].\
\
\[Highlight the key lesson\].\
\
In many areas of life, \[core idea\] applies too:\
\

- \[Example 1: Relatable scenario\].\
  \
- \[Example 2: Relatable scenario\].\
  \
- \[Example 3: Relatable scenario\].\
  \
  \
  \[Empowering conclusion or actionable takeaway\].\
  \

## 125\. 2 Hooks Are Better Than 1\

\
To quote Lara Acosta:\
\
“Visual hooks are everything, and with a text screenshot, you double your chances of capturing attention.The 1st hook is in your copy, the 2nd one is the image."\
\
An image hook also takes up more real estate on the feed, increasing your chances of stopping the scroll.\
\
**Pro tip:** 1080 x 1350 px is a great aspect ratio for your image hooks (and carousels).\
\

## 126\. How To NOT Come Across Like An Insufferable Know-It-All\

\
Below, Renee clarifies two terms that often get mixed up. However, her approach ensures her audience feels supported rather than lectured. Here are 3 trust-building things she does:\
\

1. First, she **states who the post is for** (“Whether you’re looking to hire an online writer or position yourself as one…”). This kinda specificity not only compels these groups to keep reading, but also boosts how much they value Renee’s advice.\
   \
2. Next, Renee **admits that initially, she too was confused by these terms**. This lowers her reader’s guard, helping them feel seen, understood.\
   \
3. She also **respects her reader’s time by giving the TL;DR** (too long; didn’t read) summary: “Simply put: A content writer educates. A copywriter converts” – before going into more detail.\
   \
   \
   These elements show Renee respects her audience, their time, and their struggles – positioning her as an ally instead of someone just flaunting their expertise.\
   \

   \

### Here’s the post template:\

\
Let's clear something up: \[Common misconception or confusion\].\
\
Whether you're \[target audience\] or \[secondary audience\], understanding this is critical.\
\
Without it, \[describe negative outcome that may occur\].\
\
I remember when I \[personal struggle related to the topic\]. It wasn't until I \[took action to resolve confusion\] that I realized \[insight\].\
\
In simple terms: \[Concise explanation of key distinction\].\
\
\[Further expand on concise explanation above, giving any relevant details or examples\].\
\
\[Briefly explain what this means for each of the audiences – how does knowing this impact any relevant actions they may take?\].\
\
\[Question for audience or call to action\].\
\

## 127\. Teasing What’s Up Ahead\

\
Below, Dan challenges two common misconceptions. Then outlines what’s at stake if freelancers fail to take action.\
\
Reading this, the reader will want to know what steps they can take to avoid this negative fate. They’re now primed for a solution.\
\
Dan then empowers the reader to change their mindset and take action, before teasing his upcoming content: “...stay tuned over the next week for precise details on how to pitch even 1000 new prospects in a month!!”\
\
No post is a one-and-done.\
\
Think of each post as a launch pad, a portal into a wider content universe.\

Important reminder for \[target audience\]:\

\[Common action\] is not \[negative assumption\]. But if you avoid it, you’ll risk \[undesirable consequence(s)\].\
\
I get it — some of you might \[briefly qualify who this may not apply to\]. But for most of us, this is essential.\

\

## 128\. Validate Your Claims – Here’s How:\

\
Bold claims often capture attention. But here’s the thing…\
\
The internet is flooded with exaggerated statements.\
\
If you want your audience to buy into what you claim, you must back up what you’re saying. This helps combat skepticism, reassuring people that you’re not just spouting hot air.\
\
Here’s Andrew’s hook: “Young people don’t realize the opportunity that lies in the insurance sector.” Next, he cites some compelling stats to validate this claim and foster trust.\
\
Here are 5 more ways to validate your claims:\
\

- Quotes or feedback from credible individuals\
  \
- Historical data – e.g. trends or past events\
  \
- Customer testimonials\
  \
- Relevant anecdotes\
  \
- Business results\
  \
  \
  ![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/bkHBdFCdCqga5k2c1wdj5sa2U7I.png)\
  \

### Here’s the post template:\

\
\[Target audience\] don't realise \[briefly state hidden opportunity that exists\].\
\
\[Compelling stats or facts that back up claim from above\].\
\
\[Industry/field/role\] is often seen as \[negative stereotype\].\
\
But that's exactly why \[target audience\] should \[take positive action\].\
\
\[Benefits or reasons to pursue this course of action\].\
\
\[Question for audience or call to action\].\
\

## 129\. “Don’t state. Quote” – Jasmin Alić\

\
Here’s why (in Jasmin’s words):\
\
Quotes make statements “relatable”\
\
It’s as if someone already said it\
\
They make the reader trust the words they “hear”\
\
They instruct the reader to nod in (disagreement)\
\
For example…\

## 130\. The 2nd Most Engaging Word In The English Language\

\
Do you know what it is?\
\
Well, it’s not your name. Your name is the MOST engaging word you’ll hear. Even when someone says it from across a crowded room, your ears will prick up like a meerkat.\

## 131\. Creating Content Can Be A Massive Waste Of Time (Unless You Can Answer This…)\

\
Why do you (want to) create content?\
\
For instance, you may want to:\
\

- Grow an engaged audience of prospects and peers\
  \
- Increase your newsletter subscribership (like Matt)\
  \
- Establish yourself as an expert in your field\
  \
- Drive more leads and/or sales\
  \
- Funnel traffic to your website\
  \
- Foster an online community\
  \
  \
  Having clear \*content goals\* makes everything easier. It helps you plan ahead, track what’s working, improve, and stay consistent.\
  \
  In contrast, not having clear content goals is like driving at night with no headlights.\
  \
  You end up posting content that does nothing to move your business forward. You work harder than you need to. And it’s the key reason why many creators grow frustrated and quit.\
  \
  So take a moment to answer this: **What are your content goals?**\
  \
  **Pro tip:** keep it simple – choose 1-3 content goals and move on.\
  \
  (Btw, if you’re starting out, posting on a regular cadence – say, 3x a week for a month – could be your goal. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. But remember to review and revise your content goals as you progress, so you don’t stagnate)\

## 132\. How To Establish A Strong Visual Brand (Even If You Know Nothing About Design)\

\
People will judge you (and what you offer) based on how you visually present yourself on LinkedIn.\
\
Your profile pic. Your images. Carousels. Videos. Even how you format your writing – all these are visual cues that help you:\
\

- Differentiate yourself\
  \
- Establish a recognisable brand\
  \
- And signal trust, professionalism, and attention to detail\
  \
  \
  As Daniel points out, there are a number of reasons why brand matters. But the most important is the feeling your brand conveys.\
  \
  Some tips to help you establish a strong visual brand (even if you know nothing about design):\
  \

1. **Use a clear, high-quality headshot** (see below for 3 proven headshot examples)\
   \
2. **Use 1 or 2 clean, readable fonts for any graphics** (e.g. you can’t go wrong with: Roboto, Arial, Montserrat, Open Sans, or Lato). Avoid overly decorative styles to ensure your content is easy to read and looks professional.\
   \
3. **Stick to a consistent colour palette** that fits your personality and is appropriate for your field/industry. Colours play a major role in decision-making. So if you’re unsure about brand colours, check out [this article/video by Canva](https://www.canva.com/learn/choose-right-colors-brand/). Or, consult a designer who specialises in visual identity.\
   \
4. **Canva is a great graphic design tool for 99% of non-designers**. The free version should be more than enough to get you started.\
   \
5. **Use whitespace strategically** to keep your visuals clean and uncluttered. Whitespace can also help draw attention to important text or image elements.\
   \
6. **Use high-resolution images**. LinkedIn compresses any files you upload, which can make low-resolution graphics blurry.\
   \
7. **Dark text on light backgrounds. Light text on dark backgrounds.** Always.\
   \
   \
   **Quick disclaimer:** While visual branding is important, the message you put out is king. Focus on clearly expressing your ideas first, then think about design.\

## 133\. The 'Frustration - Promise - Exclusivity' Hook Framework\

\
Below, Grace uses a clever hook framework that:\
\

1. **Addresses a frustration that implies who it’s for:**“If you’re wondering why your social media posts are falling on deaf ears…”\
   \
2. **Makes a promise of what people will get if they keep reading:**“...I’ve got a hack for you…”\
   \
3. **Teases exclusivity, heightening curiosity:**“...I’ve never shared this before\]”

A triple threat.

Here’s another example of the 'Frustration - Promise - Exclusivity' framework in action:

“Wondering why your team isn’t performing at their best? It might be because of this one leadership mistake (that even seasoned leaders make)”

Not bad, eh? Try it.

It’s called ‘\[Name of Technique or Framework\]’.

Let me explain…

\[Briefly describe the technique and how it works. Focus on what makes it unique or effective.\]

When I \[took specific action\], I realised I needed to do more than just \[describe an outdated or ineffective approach\].

So I started \[explain how you used the technique, step by step\].

\[State the critical element that made this strategy work.\] \[Describe specific desirable outcomes/results gained\].

Why am I sharing this now?

Because \[mention resource, timing, and/or why it’s relevant today\].

## 134\. How To Share Steps In A Memorable Way

Many creators share step-by-step solutions to things. But unless the reader can easily recall those steps, it’s unlikely they’ll take action.

So take a leaf out of Timothy’s book.

Turn your step-by-step solutions into simple, memorable acronyms. Here’s how:

1. **C** apture the steps - of your solution

2. **L** ist the keywords - that relate to each step

3. **E** xplore first letter combinations - to make a memorable word/acronym

4. **A** dd a supporting phrase - e.g. Timothy’s would be: STIRS - a 5-step playbook to help you build an influential network

5. **R** ecall and refine - Give it 5 minutes and refer back to just the acronym to see if you can easily recall each step

There we have it: ‘CLEAR - the 5-step framework to help you turn your step-by-step solutions into simple, memorable acronyms’

Or, you can just use this ChatGPT prompt to make coming up with acronyms even easier:

“Here are X steps that help \[target audience\] to \[achieve desirable outcome\]:

\[List each step of your solution here\].

Please generate 5 potential acronyms to help me memorise this X-step solution.”

I call it ‘\[Name of Method/Framework\].’

- \[Step 1 Title\]

\[Briefly explain what to do first and why it matters\].

## 136\. The Treasure You Seek Isn’t (Necessarily) On LinkedIn

There’s a ton of valuable information online that’s crying out to be LinkedIn-ified.

The problem is it’s often:

- Not optimised for skimmers

- Scattered across multiple sites

- Or, buried in articles that no one reads

Interesting product and industry developments can easily fly under the radar. Unless creators help bring these noteworthy events to the surface.

So if you already keep up with industry news, why not create content about it – like Ruben has…

## 137\. Avoid This Mistake When Marketing Your Business

“Don’t tell me what to think of you” – Alex M H Smith

Not once does Sadaf:

Tell the reader she’s “creative.”

Tell the reader she’s an “expert.”

Tell the reader she delivers “great service.”

Instead, Sadaf shows them what she can do – with:

- Tangible results

- A ‘before & after’ image of her work, and

- An insightful rationale that demonstrates her expertise

Weed out any adjectives that tell people what to think of you.

Show them why they should work with you instead.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/GuaOyMW4Q9mrpVZjhjM3VVHlAU.png)

### Here’s the post template:

This 1 \[small change or tweak\] \[achieved surprising outcome\].

\[Key element 1\] is the same.

\[Key element 2\] is the same.

So why does it work better?

The answer is \[core principle/strategy\].

While \[core principle/strategy\] seems simple, it’s \[explain what people miss/why it’s harder than it seems\].

It requires \[specific skill/mindset/resource\].

Most \[role/profession/group\] \[encounter common related frustration/challenge\].

Instead of \[pain point\], you could:

\[Expand on how your alternative solution is delivered in a way that’s faster, easier, more efficient, or more cost-effective\].

The result?

- \[Key benefit 1\].

- \[Key benefit 2\].

- \[Key benefit 3\].

## 138\. “Don’t Play The Engagement Game” – Ryan Musselman

If you don’t offer LinkedIn services, don’t talk about LinkedIn growth.

If you don’t help leaders, don’t give leadership advice.

As a general rule: If it doesn’t relate to what you sell, don’t talk about it.

As Ryan says, “stay on topic.” You’ll make more money.

### Here’s the post template:

\[Platform/context/product\] isn’t for \[outdated goal/focus\] anymore – it’s for \[new goal/focus\].

(But only for those who \[take specific approach\]).

Here’s what most people do wrong:

\[List common mistakes\].

The truth is, \[restate/reinforce key idea\].

Don’t play the \[ineffective strategy\] game.

If you’re a \[target audience\] and you \[describe area of focus\], don’t \[take ineffective actions\].

Focus on \[action(s)/approach/strategy\].

\[Briefly expand\].

Let’s take an example:

\[Describe an example of what to do instead\].

Do you see the strategy here?

\[Key takeaway(s)\].

\[Question for audience or call to action\].

## 139\. Which Fears Are You Leaving Unaddressed?

Many posts lay out a problem, then provide a solution.

The ‘problem-solution’ framework – it’s simple and it works.

However, there's a catch.

If the reader doesn’t believe they can succeed, they won’t act on your advice. No matter how logical your solution is, you’ll fail to persuade the reader. Why?

As Jacob points out, fear is often the biggest obstacle. So whenever you propose a solution, look to alleviate any fears that may prevent the reader from taking action.

Common fears include:

- Fear of **wasting time**

- Fear of **being misled**

- Fear of **being judged**

- Fear of **losing control**

- Fear of **wasting money**

- Fear of **failure** (see below)

- Fear of **missing out** (FOMO)

## 140\. 3 Things (Almost) All Great Stories Have

1. **Intention - what is the main character’s goal?** Whether that’s an individual, an entity, your reader, or you.

**In Stéphanie’s post:** her goal (that she shares with her reader) is to build a creator business.

2. **Obstacle - what stands in their way?** Plain sailing doesn’t make for a good story. Conflict, challenges, obstacles are what keep people hanging off your every word.

**In Stéphanie’s post:** her obstacles include no blueprint, huge uncertainty, and months of no clarity.

3. **Resolution** **\- how does it work out for them?** The reader will want to know. You’ve built tension. Now it’s time to provide a satisfying resolve.

**In Stéphanie’s post:** she presents powerful stories as a solution.

“I worship at the altar of intention and obstacle. Somebody wants something, and something is standing in their way of getting it.”

— Aaron Sorkin (renowned screenwriter and film director)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Specific action/strategy/task\] is hard.

You \[expand on what people typically go through\].

Most people don’t understand that \[goal/process\] is like \[short analogy\]:

- \[Challenge 1\].

- \[Challenge 3\].

Until you \[make this realisation/reach this milestone\].

After \[gaining this experience/share result(s) you’ve driven\], I’ve found there’s one thing that \[strategy/habit/tool/mindset\] does:

- It \[unlocks benefit 1\].

- It \[unlocks benefit 2\].

- It \[unlocks benefit 3\].

When you \[take related action\], you \[unlock core desirable outcome\].

## 141\. An Age-Old Copywriting Trick

The ‘without’ framework.

Nic’s hook:

"I made my first $20k as a ghostwriter **without** anyone asking where I went to college."

Broken down:

“I \[achieved X\] **without**\[common expectation\].”

People are constantly looking for easier, faster, cheaper, and more accessible ways to solve their problems. But often, when you make promises, the reader will raise an eyebrow.

People are naturally sceptical. Which means, just giving sound advice isn’t enough.

First, combat any initial objections your reader may have. This helps lower their defences, and makes any desirable outcomes you promise seem more attainable.

The ‘without’ framework is one way to achieve this – some more examples:

- “I landed my dream job **without** replying to any job applications.”

- “I scaled an e-com store to $120K MRR **without** spending a dime on paid ads.”

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/7gvn9Uo4L4hnBorFl1oKbXGFWQ.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I \[achieved noteworthy milestone\] without \[relying on traditional expectation\].

Because here’s the thing:

\[Short belief or principle that contradicts expectation or objection from above\].

\[Briefly explain belief or principle\].

So, how do you \[relevant question\]?

## 142\. Not An Expert? Try This…

All creators (even well-known ones) are unfamiliar to most people. That’s why it’s important to establish credibility early. This combats the natural question new readers have:

Why should I listen to you?

Ann leverages the star power of B.J. Novak (writer, actor, director). Her reader will see this and think: “Hey, that’s the bloke from The Office. Love that show. He’s sharing tips on writing, creativity, and content creation? Go on then.”

Herein lies the power of borrowed credibility.

Here are 4 more ways you can borrow credibility to build trust with your audience:

- Cite reputable data sources

- Share customer testimonials

- Curate expert opinions or insights

- Collaborate with other established creators

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TbDispYFlrdcWo1hjLCksHgyjw.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Time period ago\], I had the privilege to \[describe the event, conversation, or interaction\].

\[Briefly share some context that gives the reader a window into something surprising and/or relatable about the scenario\].

Here’s the key thing I took away:

\[Thought-provoking observation or principle\].

Many people \[describe a shared or relatable behavior or experience\].

But \[highlight how it’s different for a specific group, skill set, or approach\].

\[Summarise the main insight in a different way\].

\[Suggest how the reader can implement the insight – e.g. describe a personal habit, tip, or tool you use to support this practice\].

If you want to \[achieve result\], \[encouraging takeaway\].

\[Question for audience or call to action\].

## 143\. Nothing Is “Original”

Everything you see, hear, and read online is a remix of past ideas. So, if you’re ever stuck for ideas:

“Think of your work as a collage. Steal two or more ideas from your favorite \[creators\] and start juxtaposing them. Voila.” – Austin Kleon

That doesn’t mean you should literally steal or plagiarise (as Nick explains). It’s about putting your own unique spin on it. To do this, take proven ideas and weave in these elements:

- Personal anecdotes and stories

- Surprising stats and facts

- Your unique perspective

- Relevant examples

- Quotes

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/yOJVqzGVHHMblCnFg7Qx9NbtI.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[State a bold or attention-grabbing observation\].

And \[state why it doesn’t affect you in the way people may expect\]:

I \[share how you’ve applied or learned from this behavior/situation 1\].

I \[share how you’ve applied or learned from this behavior/situation 2\].

I \[share how you’ve applied or learned from this behavior/situation 3\].

Here’s how I see it:

- \[State principle/insight 1\]

- \[State principle/insight 2\]

- \[State principle/insight 3\]

\[Elaborate on why this behavior/situation is important, particularly for a specific group or context\].

Now, \[clarify a potential misunderstanding or objection\].

\[Provide a contrasting perspective or reframe the concept in a positive light\].

\[Explain the consequences of misunderstanding or misusing this behavior/situation\].

The truth is, \[highlight a counterintuitive or universal insight\].

\[Introduce actionable suggestions\]:

- \[Actionable tip 1\]

- \[Actionable tip 2\]

- \[Actionable tip 3\]

\[Key takeaway/caveat\].

\[The key benefit the reader stands to gain if they take action\].

## 144\. The Power Of The Post Scriptum

You’ve probably noticed creators ending their posts with a “P.S.”

But why? Has it become cliché? Does it actually lead to more engagement? What even is it?

Let’s break down what it is, why it’s effective, and how to use it.

“P.S.” stands for the Latin term post scriptum – which means “written after.” Before computers, phones (or even typewriters), people would hand-write letters to one another. The problem is it’s hard to edit or revise a letter once it’s written. Instead, people would include extra notes at the end using a P.S.

While they’re no longer necessary, people still use them to:

- Highlight a key point

- Add a sense of urgency

- Include a final call to action

- Ask a question (like Chenell does), and

- Give posts a more friendly, letter-like feel

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/70GKg8LvQ6LbQtiViKnWCrlQKIs.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Ask a thought-provoking question or present a common challenge\].

\[Briefly explain or imply why you’re qualified to answer this question\].

\[Highlight a relatable pain point or obstacle related to the topic\].

But the good news is \[reassure the reader with a positive counterpoint, introducing your main idea\].

Here are X examples of how \[specific approach, strategy, or concept can work\]:

1\. \[Approach/strategy/concept 1\]

\[Briefly explain how this example works, including specific actions, metrics, facts, and/or anecdotes\].

2\. \[Approach/strategy/concept 2\]

\[Briefly explain how this example works, including specific actions, metrics, facts, and/or anecdotes\].

3\. \[Approach/strategy/concept 3\]

\[Briefly explain how this example works, including specific actions, metrics, facts, and/or anecdotes\].

4\. \[Approach/strategy/concept 4\]

\[Briefly explain how this example works, including specific actions, metrics, facts, and/or anecdotes\].

5\. \[Approach/strategy/concept 5\]

\[Briefly explain how this example works, including specific actions, metrics, facts, and/or anecdotes\].

While \[commonly used method or approach\] is often one of the \[easiest/fastest/most affordable or more popular\] ways to \[achieve desired outcome\], it’s not the only way.

\[Key takeaway that ties back to points discussed\].

## 145\. A Great Way To Dramatise Your Writing

Justin uses repetition to great effect:

“Trading time for money.

Trading freedom for security.

Trading happiness for status.”

These short, repeated phrases inject rhythm into his words. They’re quick and easy to read. They have the reader sailing down the page.

This dramatic literary device is known as anaphora (i.e. the repetition of a word or expression at the beginning of successive phrases, especially for rhetorical or poetic effect).

Here’s a famous example from Winston Churchill’s "We Shall Fight on the Beaches" speech:

"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/N7VNAyruoNR8srueNtYqsmEQ2i8.png)

### Here’s the post template:

\[Bold, contrarian statement that challenges conventional thinking\].

\[Use short, rhythmic sentences to highlight the problems with this mindset or system\].

\[Common misconception that’s related to the core idea\].

\[Define the core idea or concept that underpins your argument\].

- \[Relatable example 1\]

- \[Relatable example 2\]

- \[Relatable example 3\]

Most people \[state common flawed action(s)\].

Then \[state negative consequence(s)\].

Try this instead:

- \[Practical action/step 1\]

- \[Practical action/step 2\]

- \[Practical action/step 3\]

## 146\. Is Your Advice Actually Actionable, Though?

Lara doesn’t just share some interesting ideas from a book. She goes one further.

She takes the 6 core principles from Dr. Cialdini’s book Influence, a book about the art of persuasion – and shows how to apply each principle to LinkedIn. Lara makes this information practical for people.

So whenever you share insights, ask yourself:

Is the advice I’m sharing actionable or abstract?

Aim for the former.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/3nlCcYbSTmXeyMStj0twGXEAuvs.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I’ve \[explored\] many \[ideas/resources/approaches\], but this one \[unlocked benefit\]:

(And it’s not \[commonly spoken about idea/resource/approach\])

→ \[Introduce the unexpected idea/resource/approach\].

Here’s how to apply this to \[specific context\]:

- \[Key idea/principle 1\]: \[Practical application tailored to the audience/context\]

- \[Key idea/principle 2\]: \[Practical application tailored to the audience/context\]

- \[Key idea/principle 3\]: \[Practical application tailored to the audience/context\]

- \[Key idea/principle 4\]: \[Practical application tailored to the audience/context\]

- \[Key idea/principle 5\]: \[Practical application tailored to the audience/context\]

This \[idea/resource/approach\] taught me more than \[conventional alternative\].

## 147\. Digital Word Of Mouth (WOM)

In business, no words are more persuasive than those from a happy customer.

Client reviews (aka testimonials) are an incredibly powerful form of social proof. Any business can make well-worded claims about how great they are.

But when happy customers sing your praises, it makes any claims you make more believable. Testimonials show prospects that what you offer works for others like them. It’s proof of concept.

So remember to ask for, collect, and showcase testimonials.

Then feature them on your profile and in your content – like Justin does.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ixjjrk62SjnTkBsi0uCNAt1g0k.png)

### Here’s the post template:

I don’t do this often.

But I had to share it…

\[Share the reason for the self-promotion—e.g., a success story/testimonial/milestone\].

This is WHY I \[describe your mission\].

## 148\. How To Work Smarter, Not Harder

Below, Jake speaks to how and why companies should optimise old blogs rather than create new ones. He suggests it’s an easier and faster way to unlock better SEO results.

Here’s the underlying principle: work smarter, not harder.

And while he talks about blogs, this principle holds true for all types of content.

Here are 5 ways you can work smarter, not harder, as a LinkedIn creator:

- **Plan out what content you’re going to create 1-2 weeks in advance** \- create a content calendar and decide ahead of time what you need to create. This avoids deciding on the day.

- **Repurpose your content** \- turn blogs, newsletters, or comments into posts. Tweak your top performing posts and publish them again. Reformat carousels into infographics, text posts, or videos (and vice-versa).

- **Batch write posts** \- block off 1-3 hour blocks in your calendar for writing content. If you can, create content at the same times each week.

- **Keep a swipe file** \- save great posts, hooks, and ideas to inspire you when you sit down to create.

- **Lean on proven post templates** \- to help structure your writing and beat the blank page.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RFgyfX7osGEblZYvHULfALLpqo.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Please STOP \[doing common and/or ineffective practice\].

I see too many \[examples of people/businesses doing this\] that \[describe the negative outcome\], yet they’re still \[repeating the ineffective practice\].

If you’re already \[doing related action\], try this instead:

- \[Actionable step 1\]

- \[Actionable step 2\]

- \[Actionable step 3\]

- \[Actionable step 4\]

\[Expand where needed AND/OR clarify what needs clarifying AND/OR include some relatable examples\]

You’ll achieve \[positive outcome\] much faster by \[restating the new focus\] rather than \[repeating the ineffective practice\].

Try it for the next \[time frame\] and see what happens.

\[Question for audience or call to action\].

## 149\. All Top 1% Creators Understand This

“The secret isn't how well you write. It's how well you use contrast.” – Taylin John Simmonds

Contrast is a powerful literary device. It can shift your writing from “meh” to “Wow, that’s so well written!” It makes your ideas, stories, and solutions more vivid, persuasive, and memorable.

Below, Codie contrasts her father’s ethical approach to business with his business partner’s selfish approach. This stark contrast adds tension, drama, and interest to the story – while reinforcing the over-arching lesson.

Some more ways to use contrast in your content:

- Old vs. new

- Before & after

- Success vs. failure

- Struggle vs. triumph

- Problem vs. solution

- The wrong way vs. the right way

- Ethical vs. unethical (see Codie’s story)

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CwmWHEG59xLOY2cYVrkEJMCzCQI.png)

### Here’s the post template:

A story \[from someone significant or memorable\].

If you’re \[a relevant audience\], this might resonate with you as it did with me.

They said, \[insert a quote or a poignant statement that introduces the theme of the story\].

They’ve always \[share a notable quality or value of the person\].

But they remember this…

It was \[describe a situation or challenge they faced, focusing on the tension or stakes\].

They could just picture \[describe the impact of the situation, using relatable or emotional imagery\].

\[Detail an action they took to resolve the situation, emphasising the decision-making process or sacrifice\].

At the time, \[introduce a contrasting perspective or person to heighten the significance of the actions\].

\[Describe the contrasting perspective’s outcomes, underscoring the lesson or takeaway\].

And in all these years, \[highlight the enduring positive outcomes of the initial decision\].

They often attribute their \[success/happiness/lasting result\] to \[specific value/principle/action\].

## 150\. Reframing Negative Perspectives

Often, what stops people moving forward is the wrong mindset.

As a creator, it’s your job to identify common mental roadblocks that hold your prospects back. By referring to these in your content, your reader feels understood. They’ll resonate with what you’re saying, which evokes trust.

Next, take these negative mindsets and reframe them. Give your readers a new, helpful way to think about their problems. Leave them feeling optimistic – like Jasmin does…

"Always enter the conversation already occurring in the customer's mind" – Dan Kennedy

And if your next question is:

- \[Common doubt or fear posed as a question 1\]?

- \[Common doubt or fear posed as a question 2\]?

- \[Common doubt or fear posed as a question 3\]?

I challenge you to change this to:

- \[Reframed positive perspective 1\]

- \[Reframed positive perspective 2\]

- \[Reframed positive perspective 3\]

\[Share a personal or client example of progress or success, starting from a low point and leading to a high point\].

\[Empowering takeaway that fosters optimism\].

## 151\. Wanna Make (More) Money On LinkedIn? Read This

You can waste 100s of hours on LinkedIn if you’re not careful.

Many creators chase engagement and LinkedIn fame. Then neglect what’s important (i.e. making money). LinkedIn is a \*business\* platform, after all.

Instead:

- **Focus on who you're creating content for.** Avoid trying to please everyone. Start by solving one specific problem, for one specific person, in one specific way.

- **Focus on building relationships with peers and prospects.** Your content may attract people into your orbit, but it’s on you to foster meaningful conversations.

- **Focus on revenue metrics (e.g. leads and conversions) over engagement metrics.** For instance, if a prospect reaches out or buys from you, ask how they found you. Did a specific post get them over the line? Ask them.

For more money-making do’s and don’ts, see Nick’s post…

## 152\. How To Twist The Knife (Making A Problem Hurt)

Below, Ali addresses a common problem creators face:

→ Trying to compete in a crowded market/niche.

However, he doesn’t just state the problem (like above).

1. First, he gives the problem a novel, catchy name: “Niche Saturation Syndrome” – which makes it more memorable, concrete.

2. Then, he lists 3 nagging frustrations that amplify the over-arching problem in his reader’s mind.

Here, Ali uses a copywriting trick known as ‘twisting the knife.’ By vividly describing these painful consequences, his readers FEEL the problem on a visceral level. It’s like holding up a mirror and saying, “I get how hard this is for you.”

This deepens the emotional connection, which makes the solution not just a nice-to-have but a life raft when it rolls around.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TD76RGdYczccR6EcN9IWZV8OpAo.png)

### Here’s the post template:

If you’re \[target audience/aspiring group\], you’ve probably felt this:

\[Common pain point\].

- \[Specific symptom of problem 1\]

- \[Specific symptom of problem 2\]

- \[Specific symptom of problem 3\]

But here’s the thing: \[Reframe the problem or introduce a counterintuitive insight about the issue\].

\[Give a fresh perspective\].

\[Introduce a comparison or framework to explain the new perspective\].

\[Expand on concept – consider using relatable examples and vivid descriptions\].

Here’s how you can \[achieve this new perspective\]:

1. \[A specific, actionable recommendation\].

\[Explain on recommendation – what do people need to know, avoid, do? Keep advice concise and actionable\].

2. \[A specific, actionable recommendation\].

\[Explain on recommendation – what do people need to know, avoid, do? Keep advice concise and actionable\].

Don’t be afraid to ruffle some feathers. Whether people agree or disagree, they’ll let you know either way – which means more reach and engagement. Win-win.

Some tips for effectively sharing bold opinions:

- **Share opinions you actually believe in.** Avoid being devisive for the sake of it.

- **Pair opinions with valuable insight** – like Liz. This helps soften any pushback.

- **Be bold but professional.** Avoid being aggressive, vulgar, or overly negative.

- **Before you post, anticipate objections.** Consider addressing these in-post.

- **End with an open-ended question.** Show you’re open to other viewpoints.

### Here’s the post template:

Most \[field or industry\] advice is \[adjective 1\].

And \[adjective 2\].

- “\[Common advice 1\].”

- “\[Common advice 2\].”

- “\[Common advice 3\].”

Ok, but that’s not enough.

In \[current or upcoming year\], \[professionals/group\] need to do more.

For example:

1. \[Bold action 1\]

\[Expand on why this action is important, and give actionable advice\].

2. \[Bold action 2\]

\[Expand on why this action is important, and give actionable advice\].

3. \[Bold action 3\]

\[Expand on why this action is important, and give actionable advice\].

4. \[Bold action 4\]

\[Expand on why this action is important, and give actionable advice\].

\[Key takeaway\].

## 154\. Every Creator Should Use These (Advanced)

LinkedIn is NOT a reliable way to nurture prospects.

For one, they may not be online that often. And even if they are, there’s no guarantee they’ll see your content. After all, the feed is busy and only a small fraction of your audience ever sees your posts.

So what do you do? How can you stay in touch with interested parties who aren’t ready to buy yet?

Answer: Offer a **lead magnet** (a free content resource offered in exchange for a prospect’s contact info – usually an email). Once you have their email, you have a direct line to their email inbox.

## 156\. A Surefire Way To Improve Your Writing

Add specificity.

Is the athlete training?

Or is he running 400-meter sprints at 5:30 AM with a weighted vest, pushing for a personal best?

Is the venture capitalist reviewing a pitch?

Or is she scanning a 25-slide deck from a scrappy founder who bootstrapped to $1.3M ARR with zero paid marketing?

Vagueness saps energy. Add depth, colour, and believability to your words with:

- Vivid language

- Sensory details

- Strong action verbs

- And numbers, results, evidence (as Reno points out)

## 157\. A Trick To Fire Up Your Reader’s Brain

Tony Robbins is a freak of nature.

He's the No.1 life coach in the world.

His businesses do $7B in yearly revenue.

And he’s the highest paid public speaker of all time.

He engages audiences of thousands of people for 12+ hours a day across 4-6 day seminars.

Have you ever sat and listened to someone talk for 12 hours? Probably not, right? But the reason Tony can is because his audience doesn’t just sit there, passively consuming. They dance, move, scream, converse, and walk barefoot across molten coals.

They actively participate.

Here’s a great way to actively engage your (online) audience:

Ask reflective questions.

Below, Rachel lists 4 questions people can use when deciding on what meetings to attend. Her questions engage her reader’s mind. They help people self-diagnose problems. They empower decision-making.

So rather than just stating advice, pepper in questions to spark reflection.

Turn your audience from passive readers into active participants.

## 158\. Unsure What To Write? Try This

Many aspiring creators never hit “Post” because they don’t know what to say.

If this sounds familiar, or if writer’s block plagues you, then try this:

Write to your past self.

Cast your mind back. Picture the challenges you once faced and overcame. It can be the you of 2+ years ago, or it can be the you from 2 days ago – it doesn’t matter.

Take Andy’s post. He received some rather blunt feedback on a sales call. Rather than puff up like a blowfish and sulk, he used this feedback to re-evaluate his approach. The result? 7 practical strategies to listen more on sales calls. Boom.

Use LinkedIn as an excuse to distill any useful knowledge trapped inside your head.

Over time, your mind will grow sharper, clearer. You’ll become a magnet for likeminded people. All while showcasing your problem-solving prowess to an audience of people actively looking to throw money at problems.

Write to your past self. Share your solution to yesterday’s problems.

## 159\. A Timeless Copywriting Technique

Josue’s first sentence? 5 words.

He doesn’t cross this 5 word threshold for another 5 lines.

By which point, we’re hooked.

Herein lies The Slippery Slide Effect – a technique coined by copywriting legend Joe Sugarman.

The goal is get the reader flying down the page from the start. This lightens the cognitive load of reading. And enables quick, rewarding progress, which means the meat of your post stands more chance of being read.

To harness The Slippery Slide Effect:

- Start posts with short, punchy sentences (≤ 9 words)

- Keep paragraphs short (1-2 sentences max)

- Avoid (or limit) long multisyllabic words

- Break up lists into bullets

- And use line breaks

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UgtyoIp6QpQNt9Dw9G6STOMrEo.png)

### Here’s the post template:

Most \[people/group\] \[make common mistake\].

They think they need:

- \[Common but unnecessary approach/mindset 1\]

- \[Common but unnecessary approach/mindset 2\]

- \[Common but unnecessary approach/mindset 3\]

I followed this path for a long time.

Until I discovered a simple \[framework/method\] that changed everything.

Here’s how it works:

Start by defining \[core principle or guiding statement\]:

\[List steps, give practical tips and/or examples\].

The result?

\[Transformation or impact achieved by following the framework/method\].

\[Key takeaway\].

Give it a try.
